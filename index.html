            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I've been exploring the idea of art directed websites and web apps. This just means that you're doing something more than just stacking elements on top of each other. You're using the classic principles of design in a way that other media have been using them for the past 100 or so years. Magazines, books, movies&mdash;all of these are being art directed by someone.</p>
              <p>Art direction is someone having a vision for communicating ideas in a certain way. There is a way to art direct a movie, photo shoot, book, or magazine. They aren't exactly the same, but the same principles are involved. In the end, it's about communicating an idea or feeling or thought to the viewer/reader through the design itself, not just the content.</p>
              <p>For most of its existence, the Web has been focused on the technical aspects of communicating information to users. <i>Can we get it to do what we want?</i> That's been a big question. I think this is where we got design systems and frameworks. They can quickly scale up a site or app that works and doesn't look horrid.</p>
              <p>That's been fine and good for a long time. However, new advances in the tools of the presentation layer, such as CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox, are opening up new possibilities. When we figure out that there is more room to stretch out and play&mdash;and the users are also expecting there to be more polished visual communication&mdash;then we should start to see that show up on the sites that we're building.</p>
              <p>As a front end developer I've had the privilege to watch this change happen over the past 20 years. The things that I've dreamed about since I was young are actually possible now. Visions and what-ifs that I had many years ago are what I'm designing and creating today. It's awesome.</p>
              <p>But now is the work. Now is the time to take those dreams and begin to build them. Now is the time to look at the amazing designs on <a href="https://behance.net" target="_blank">Behance</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> and begin to build them on the Web. Now is the time to learn CSS Grid and begin to play with it to see what it will do.</p>
              <p>I hope that we can gradually move out of this rut of stacking blocks on top of one another and instead <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/4057" target="_blank">think more like Mondrian</a>. He painted blocks, but the blocks became interesting and beautiful and speak to something far beyond just a bunch of blocks on top of one another.</p>
