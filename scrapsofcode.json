I'm trying to incorporate a more sustainable model for writing the posts. \n\nIn this iteration I'm using Mavo.io to add in-browser editing. This allows me to create posts without getting into any code. I just go to the home feed, login to Github, and start creating a new post using Mavo's interface. \n\nOne of the things I also notice is that I spend a lot of time figuring out interesting workarounds or layouts for work and those just sort of get lost in the shuffle of new things coming across my desk. I hope to capture a few more of those here on the blog so that I can revisit them and others can learn from my ~~mistakes~~ efforts.\n\nSo maybe not a post a day, but when things are blog worthy or I release a new tutorial video, it will get collected here.\n\nImpressed and want to share this wisdom with others, use the social icons to the right at the bottom of the viewport. To link to a specific post, click on the link icon opposite the post date. Take that link and share it with you will. It will send the user directly to the post on this page.\n\nTake the time to follow me on Twitter. I share interesting articles and tidbits there that probably won't wind up here. You can also use Twitter to leave me a comment or DM me if you'd like to talk. I look forward to connecting with you."
