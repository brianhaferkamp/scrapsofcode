I'm trying to incorporate a more sustainable model for writing the posts. \n\nIn this iteration I'm using Mavo.io to add in-browser editing. This allows me to create posts without getting into any code. I just go to the home feed, login to Github, and start creating a new post using Mavo's interface. \n\nOne of the things I also notice is that I spend a lot of time figuring out interesting workarounds or layouts for work and those just sort of get lost in the shuffle of new things coming across my desk. I hope to capture a few more of those here on the blog so that I can revisit them and others can learn from my ~~mistakes~~ efforts.\n\nSo maybe not a post a day, but when things are blog worthy or I release a new tutorial video, it will get collected here."
