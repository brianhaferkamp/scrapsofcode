              <p>I get caught in a fight between the utility of the Web and the beauty of it. I want to make things beautiful and hand crafted, but we always have to remember the limitations of the current wave of mobile devices.</p>
              <p>Art direction for the Web is a real thing with the advent of CSS Grid and Flexbox. We now have strong control of the way elements can be laid out on the Web. However, I sometimes get disheartened by the need for utility on the Web because of how many people are accessing our sites and apps via current mobile devices. We have all the ability in the world to create Ferarris but everyone is driving a Smart Car.</p>
              <p>What helps me to continue pushing forward with these ideas is that the mobile future is wearable. One day we'll all put our smart phones down and put on a pair of glasses that overlays the world with all of the beautiful things we can create. Reality will probably be much different this vision, but I can dream, right?</p>
              <p>When this future comes, we'll be able to art direct all of the digital artifacts&mdash;beautiful virtual magazines and newspapers!&mdash;that we create and people will actually be able to notice the beauty of the Web over its utility. I'm thankful for where we are right now, but I'm tired of the internal tug of war. I'm ready for awesome layouts to mean something. I'm tired of stacking boxes.</p>

              <p>Centering things in front end development has often been a pain in the neck over the years. However, advances in CSS3 over the past several years make centering kind of a breeze. (Don't tell that to the designers, though). Here is a pen showing you how to do the most obvious forms of CSS centering, from the easy <code>text-align</code> property to the more challenging ordeal of centering an absolute positioned element. Uncomment the CSS snippets to see the <code>.child</code> element move in real time. Oh, browser sync, we love you.</p>

            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/ghosted.jpg" alt="A man sitting cross-legged on a park bench seemingly unaware there is a ghost standing behind him"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>In the past month I've been ghosted by two clients.</p>
              <p>I guess I don't mind it so much. It's a part of dealing with lower end clients. Well, freelance projects, in general.</p>
              <p>The thing that bothers me about it is that I don't get a chance to talk through the objections. They don't even say, "Hey! That's way too much money. How can you charge that??" I could at least answer that and get into a money talk with them.</p>
              <p>I'm not looking for a lot. Just a "no, thanks" or "I saw your proposal and it's not a good fit." Something like that.</p>
              <P>I watch a lot of videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSkoolRocks" target="_blank">The Futur</a> on YouTube. They share content for creative professionals on handling clients and more of the business/psychology side of being a creative in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/J6Su5Vx3x5U" target="_blank">(Here's a particularly good stream on pricing creative work.)</a></P>
              <p>They suggest having the money talk very early on. From my experiences above, it seems like the best course of action. Between the lead call and proposal I spend a couple of hours that don't get recouped at all. At least a critique of my process or proposal would be worth the time I put into it. It could help me get better.</p>
              <p>If you're a freelancer, have you had similar experiences with clients? Is it something that is getting more or less prevalent? If you've been able to find a way around it, please share.</p>
              <p>I'd love to hear your experiences. Click on the tweet below to share with the Scraps of Code community.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">A Brief Apology for jQuery</h3>
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/jquery.jpg" alt="Books about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery sitting on a shelf next to a cactus"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I would consider myself a hybrid designer/developer. Development skills are what puts money into the bank account but I am a designer at heart. I started learning JavaScript back in the early 2000s, long before it was "everywhere." Back then I understood the object oriented programming concepts but JavaScript just didn't click like HTML and CSS. So I would get frustrated and go back to design and UI.</p>
              <p>When I started working in web development I needed to get some everyday JavaScript under my belt so I could just do the expected levels of interaction on a given website. (There is an expected level.) So I started watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">DevTips</a> videos where <a href="http://travisneilson.com/" target="_blank">Travis Neilson</a> was showing how to work with jQuery. (Here's a good playlist to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt49y1gm0jw&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KOekRWjjajinzlRK879Ksn" target="_blank">learn jQuery in 15 minutes</a>.) Mostly it was just the basics of how to use it and what you can do with it. Being a designer-developer, Travis' videos were perfect for me. I felt that we spoke the same language. So I started working with jQuery almost exclusively (although now I know how to convert things back and forth to vanilla JS, when necessary).</p>
              <p>For years now people have tried to get away from jQuery because it's an extra 30kb download (30kb...for shame!). I mean, seriously, the average web page is over 2mb. I don't really want to hear talk about an extra 30kb.</p>
              <p>For me, jQuery represents a bridge to JavaScript, much like Algebra is a bridge to higher level mathematics for many. jQuery uses real words. It shortens things up so you can just use a method to do things. It makes my code more readable. Essentially, it's designer speak not developer speak.</p>
              <p>I'm sticking with jQuery.</p>

              <p>I've been working a lot, both personally and professionally, with APIs and data over the past year. I have also built a <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAMstack</a> app: <a href="https://skmmr.news" target="_blank">skmmr.news</a>. One of the first APIs I started working with is the <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers" target="_blank">Unsplash API</a>. You get access to almost 1 million free to use (for any purpose) images and the API is very well documented. I highly encourage it as a starting point if you're new to APIs. In fact, I created this video as an introduction to using APIs to get data for your website or web app. Once you're finished watching, I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caRGl-IucCQ&list=PLMklnyuK-t1EM3dv5MYD30oAKJijvSxJd" target="_blank">YouTube playlist of several other videos focusing on developing applications with APIs</a>.</p>

              <p>Today I wanted to share a bit of code I created back in 2017. It's a very basic portfolio filtering system using jQuery hide/show to add and remove classes on click. I can't imagine it would be difficult to add some basic animations, like fade in/out.</p>
              <p>The reason I made this was to see how far down I could boil a filtering system for a portfolio. Sometimes a simple solution is all I need. Though there are a lot of plugins available, I needed something simple that just works right out of the box.</p>
              <p>The grid is created using CSS Grid Layout and is fully responsive. Feel free to use it in any of your projects.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">Listening for Appropriate Solutions</h3>
            <!-- h3.stories-group-subheadline-->
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/woman-listening.jpg" alt="One woman talking and one woman listening next to a laptop computer"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>One of the struggles of any profession is providing appropriate solutions to problems. The old adage is, "To a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Web developers are no different. For the JavaScript specialist, everything can be fixed with JS. For the PHP developer, everything can be solved with databases and PHP. But what if the needs of the client are not conducive to your primary skill set? This is where the challenge comes in. Do you continue forward knowing that what you're going to build is a lot more complicated than the client needs? Or will you convey to the client they need something else then refer them to someone who can more appropriately handle his/her needs? Maybe you choose a third way and build what is appropriate but with secondary or tertiary skills. That's an option, too.</p>
              <p>One way to help clients is to listen to them and ask them questions that help determine an appropriate path. Do they just need something small and lightweight that won't be changing anytime soon? Perhaps a standard HTML landing page is the best way to go. Do they need a little more but not quite a full-blown system that needs to be managed? Look into a larger HTML site but using something like <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> to manage it. Does the client think he/she needs a small site when he/she really needs a fully managed CMS? Then explain how a management system can make the client's life easier. You are the consultant. You are fluent in Web things. Your expertise matters here at the front end of the project.</p>
              <p>The problem with doing everything one way for all clients is that you put the client in a bad position. In doing this the developer is not looking out for the client. Instead, he/she is pushing his/her own system onto the client and ignoring the consequences that the client will have to live with. This started happening several years ago when devs began building so many sites with WordPress. The reality is that most clients don't need that level of sophistication. They just need a brochure site. WordPress is a system, though. A great system for creating dynamic content, but not a great system for creating sites that should just be static HTML. So it was an inappropriate build for many clients, but it was done because there were devs who could build the sites that way and clients who were being educated poorly about what they needed.</p>
              <p>So here's a solution. Listen to the client. Determine the most appropriate development solution/stack/platform and then either deliver that out of your own knowledge or begin to create a network of other devs/agencies that you can pass clients along to who specialize in the work the client needs. Consider setting up a small finders fee, if the person/agency is willing. It would be better to make a client happy because you listened to him/her and provided an appropriate solution. Burdening the client with the responsibilities of a printing press when all he/she needed was a printer is irresponsible and short-sighted. Let's do better.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">What is a Website?</h3>
            <h3 class="stories-group-subheadline">Thoughts on understanding the value of a website</h3>
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/client-consultation.jpg" alt="Three people sitting across the table from one another talking"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I sometimes have freelance clients who want me to build a website for them. Often, they are small businesses or solopreneurs. Many of them have no idea about websites or apps or what goes into building them. After the conversation they are surprised by the amount of work (and money) it costs to build a website. I often don't hear back from them. No negotiation. No questions.</p>
              <p>I wonder sometimes if it would be helpful for them to understand what a website is. That way they could see the actual value of the website and it would be easier to attach a proper monetary value on the building of it.</p>
              <p>So what is a website? These are the first 3 things I can think of:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>It is a platform in virtual space.</b> Just like we build offices in the real world to handle business, provide work environments for employees, and to communicate with clients, a website does that in a virtual space. It says, "We exist. This is where you can find us."</li>
                <li><b>It is your chief virtual marketer.</b> Almost all businesses need some form of marketing/sales. A website is a virtual marketer or salesperson that works 24/7, dresses how you want, and only says what you want it to say. Its reach is global. It can speak multiple languages. It never sleeps and never gets weary. It doesn't need a lunch break. This is a valuable employee.</li>
                <li><b>It is a portal for continuous two-way communication.</b> Direct mail, advertising, email marketing--these are all one-way communication to prospective clients/customers. A website can provide two-way communication via email forms or live chat. It is a platform to schedule consultations and meetings. What it also does is give prospects a way to proactively reach out to you (giving permission), thereby empowering the client/customer. This is a great feeling in our modern age and lets prospects see you in a new light.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Based just on those three things, what would a client pay to have that available to him/her? What is the value of all those things? What is the value of a new office space? What is the value of a marketer or salesperson who never sleeps? What is the value of a two-way portal to clients? $100? $1000? $100,000? These are the questions that clients need to be confronted with.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering if I need to have the value talk first thing in the conversation just to lay the groundwork for the value that is being provided to the client. Then we can get into the nitty gritty of what will be on the site itself. Maybe that would change the whole conversation about monetary value.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">A Cog in the White Collar Assembly Line</h3>
            <h4 class="stories-group-date">May 8, 2019</h4>
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/mcdonalds-assembly-line.jpg" alt="McDonalds workers putting food together on an assembly line"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Today, I read an interesting article called, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-mcdonaldization-of-ux-705438fea958" target="_blank"><i>The McDonaldization of UX</i></a>. The author writes about the standardization of UX design team practices across major corporations and how that has turned him into a "wireframing monkey." There is no longer any creativity or risk. He is merely a cog in a white collar assembly line.</p>
              <p>I'm a front end developer in a corporate marketing department and often feel the same way as the author of the article above. I receive designs that largely look like the last ones (for the sake of consistency) that need to go out in 1-4 week windows. In many ways, I feel like an assembly line piece, too. This has been a source of consternation for me over the past few years. It's a job I've wanted for much of my adult life. The benefits are good. The pay is okay. The company cares about the employees. There is also some security being in a 500-year-old industry.</p>
              <p>How did it get this way, though? For many of the same reasons the article states: <i>Time pressures</i> (time to market, marketing deadlines, launch dates), <i>efficiency</i> (forced by downward pressures in the market), <i>lack of understanding of the process of design and development</i> (seeing us as service providers only and not as people who can bring any strategy to whole process), and <i>product diversification</i> (instead of continuously working on one solid product, creating many sub-branded offshoots of one bestseller). In a world where digital matters and there is so much downward pressure, corners must be cut to keep up. So we create more efficiency, use more frameworks, create more design systems, etc. to keep up. Be creative once and then repeat it&mdash;a lot.</p>
              <p>However, one of the joys of web development is continually learning new things and producing a level of craft that matters. Sadly, corporate web development is based on as close to zero risk as you can get. Corporations make money by pumping out the same things over and over again. So I've become a code monkey of sorts.</p>
              <p>How does one get out of this rut? Seems to me there are three good options:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Quit and join a startup or small agency.</b> If you do this just remember that most startups are trying to get to the level of the company you just left. All that freedom and creativity will go away as growth happens. It's not often that web developers are asked to continuously push forward in mature companies.</li>
                <li><b>Take on side work.</b> Ah, the old side hustle. Start advertising yourself as a freelancer. The beautiful part is that you only have to take on work that you would like to do with clients you would like to work with. Keep your day job and let that be your initial investor. One key here is to position yourself well so that the types of clients you want to work with come knocking. If you're working corporate and you get 3-5 of these side jobs a year it might give you just the kind of risk and outlet you need for your creativity.</li>
                <li><b>Build your own ideas.</b> A third option is to build out your own ideas. Do something with that great idea that you wish someone would make. Your job doesn't want to take your suggestion on a new project? Build out a prototype to get their attention. That's the route that I've taken with my work. I inject time to prototype new ideas and initiatives. I show them to those who are higher than me. I share them with the designers in the company. I've even created an online team to share innovation ideas across the company. Most of these will probably not turn into anything, but it at least gives me an outlet to ideate, prototype, and share with a likeminded community within the company.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I have to believe there is a way to have my cake and eat it, too. My day job is "code monkey." What I want to do and how I want to affect the world is so much bigger, though. So I've tried to create some spaces where I can utilize all of the new things I'm learning, even if my job has no use for them. If you've outgrown your job it might not be that you need to leave the regular paycheck. It might be that you just need to build some places for your new, expansive self to go within the confines of your present life.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">Art Direction on the Web</h3>
            <h4 class="stories-group-date">May 7, 2019</h4>
            <section class="stories-image"><a title="Piet Mondrian [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Piet_Mondriaan_-_03.jpg"><img width="1024" alt="Piet Mondriaan - 03" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Piet_Mondriaan_-_03.jpg/1024px-Piet_Mondriaan_-_03.jpg"/></a></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I've been exploring the idea of art directed websites and web apps. This just means that you're doing something more than just stacking elements on top of each other. You're using the classic principles of design in a way that other media have been using them for the past 100 or so years. Magazines, books, movies&mdash;all of these are being art directed by someone.</p>
              <p>Art direction is someone having a vision for communicating ideas in a certain way. There is a way to art direct a movie, photo shoot, book, or magazine. They aren't exactly the same, but the same principles are involved. In the end, it's about communicating an idea or feeling or thought to the viewer/reader through the design itself, not just the content.</p>
              <p>For most of its existence, the Web has been focused on the technical aspects of communicating information to users. <i>Can we get it to do what we want?</i> That's been a big question. I think this is where we got design systems and frameworks. They can quickly scale up a site or app that works and doesn't look horrid.</p>
              <p>That's been fine and good for a long time. However, new advances in the tools of the presentation layer, such as CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox, are opening up new possibilities. When we figure out that there is more room to stretch out and play&mdash;and the users are also expecting there to be more polished visual communication&mdash;then we should start to see that show up on the sites that we're building.</p>
              <p>As a front end developer I've had the privilege to watch this change happen over the past 20 years. The things that I've dreamed about since I was young are actually possible now. Visions and what-ifs that I had many years ago are what I'm designing and creating today. It's awesome.</p>
              <p>But now is the work. Now is the time to take those dreams and begin to build them. Now is the time to look at the amazing designs on <a href="https://behance.net" target="_blank">Behance</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> and begin to build them on the Web. Now is the time to learn CSS Grid and begin to play with it to see what it will do.</p>
              <p>I hope that we can gradually move out of this rut of stacking blocks on top of one another and instead <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/4057" target="_blank">think more like Mondrian</a>. He painted blocks, but the blocks became interesting and beautiful and speak to something far beyond just a bunch of blocks on top of one another.</p>

              <p>I'm starting a for-real blog.</p>
              <p>It's always hard to think about the time it takes to start and maintain a blog. There are schedulers, automated systems, and a whole ecosystem of apps that are supposed to help you do it. I guess it really is about putting fingers to keyboard every day and saying <i>something</i>.</p>
              <p>My hope is that the little scraps of code I put on this blog help people solve very real problems as front end developers. If you're learning, buckle up. There's a lot to know and the rabbit hole just keeps going. For the veterans, there must be a bottom, right? Probably not, which is why we get to be veterans at this.</p>
