            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Today I've cooked up a front end development challenge. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/79f0941c-a52a-46db-44a3-446086d0748a-0fc1/?hints=off" target="_blank">View the design and design specs online</a>. Code this design so that it is:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Mobile responsive</li>
                <li>Proportionately accurate</li>
                <li>Contains no accessibility errors with <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">the WAVE test</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p><i>Note: You do not have to design the bottom of the hero labeled "Design Specifics." That is just for your reference.</i></p>
              <p>When you're finished with the code, share it with me on Twitter using the card in the comments section or go to <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianHaferkamp">@brianhaferkamp</a>.  You can also leave a link to your online code (CodePen, Github Gist, whatever) in the comments section of the XD file above so I can take a look. If you don't like any of those options, feel free to email me a link at brian@highwaywebconsulting.com with "Front End Development Challenge 1" as the subject.</p>
              <p>To complete this challenge successfully, focus in on accessible HTML, CSS efficiency, and accuracy to the layout. Don't overthink it. This should be a layup. Show that you know the fundamentals.</p>

              <p>Did you know you can apply image filter effects using only CSS? With CSS3 this is possible. I created this little application to show you how it works on an image. Clicking one of the labels applies a filter using a class. It's a very cool way to art direct images one at a time or apply effects to many images at one time through a class.</p>

              <p>After a little break for American Independence Day, we're back at it!</p>
              <p>One of the things everyone can improve on is working with images for the Web. It's vital to get the best quality image at the lowest possible file size. This helps keep sites fast and doesn't force the user to use up their data unnecessarily. Think about it. If you could save someone 50-90% of the data they would use and not change their experience, why wouldn't you? It's a part of user experience and will help set off your work as better than others.</p>
              <p>I created a 2-part video series about image editing for the Web. I typically use a small image editing program (Windows only) that helps do all the little daily tasks: cropping, resizing, resampling, desaturate, save for web, etc. It's smaller than Photoshop or Lightroom, is very stable, and it's free (plus, it includes no spyware/malware). I talk about the program in video 1.</p>

              <p>In the second video I discuss how to implement responsive images in the HTML code. This has been made very easy with the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element in HTML5.</p>

              <p>Enjoy these two videos! I'll be back on Monday with something new. There is a link in the video description of the second video to a pen on Codepen where you can see the responsive code in action.</p>

              <p>I recently shared <a href="https://youtu.be/_0rPFwiniaw" target="_blank">a video that I made that shows a prototype of a retail shopping experience in augmented reality (AR)</a>. Augmented and Virtual (VR) realities are very interesting to me. I'm afraid I might not be able to participate in this next phase of the Web for a while because of a lack of skill. Maybe the tools will get simple enough for me to use. I do plan to explore it, however, and I'll share that exploration here and on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BrianHaferkamp" target="_blank">@brianhaferkamp</a>).</p>
              <p>I don't know that my present company will go for it but I plan to build out the shopping experience I referenced in the video I shared before. The goal is to create a portal between the virtual and physical space that allows the shopper to participate in both realities simultaneously. He or she is at once moving seamlessly from physical to virtual reality and back again.</p>
              <p>There are tools available right now that will allow us to create experiences for the Web in AR and VR. I've used <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> before (VR), which is based on HTML and <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a>. I have read about <a href="https://createwebvr.com/webAR.html" target="_blank">WebAR</a> (AR) and <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js" target="_blank">AR.js</a>. I'm anxious to dig into that and try it out. You know me and the Web. I am forever bullish about the Web over proprietary systems. Its universal nature (and the fact that it's so heavily supported by Google) make it the obvious choice (at least to me) to build on for the future.</p>
              <p>What are you thinking about AR and VR? Have you ever worked with it? Are you paying attention to it? What have you learned?</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>When I was first starting out there was one position for someone who built things on the Web: Webmaster. The webmaster designed and developed the website. Now we have front end and back end engineers, devOps, IS/IT, and designers.</p>
              <p>I suppose I understand the disconnect between the front end and the back end. What I don't understand is separating design from front end development. I think the fact that there is often friction in the relationship of designers and front end engineers should tell us that those positions are not best separated.</p>
              <p>To me, a front end developer should be able to design and a designer should be able to develop front end code--HTML, CSS, and a low-level knowledge of JavaScript.</p>
              <p>In my experience a lot of friction happens between design and development because neither understands what the other is saying. I suppose one is predominantly right brained and the other left brained, but there doesn't seem to be any reason for them not to be able to speak the same language. Front end developers have often complained about the pickiness of designers and how things can't always be pixel perfect. Designers often complain about the limitations of the code and how their designs are changed or not accepted altogether.</p>
              <p>If a designer knows the limitations of the code or how a web page or application is built then he or she could understand how their design would be implemented before he/she begins the design.</p>
              <p>Likewise, if a developer understands how important the right colors, size, hierarchy, spacing, etc. are for communicating to the user then he or she could develop better code and understand why it's important to stick closely to the visual design.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is that designers branch out and learn front end code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and front end developers learn the basic concepts of design (spacing, hierarchy, typography, etc). Even if we have separation of our actual duties, being able to speak each other's languages could help to make better design and code choices.</p>

              <p>There is a lot to web development and design. Some of the best tutorial series I've come across are the ones that take you through the entire process of designing and developing a website. For a company that already has a website this starts with a critique of the current site. Today I'm sharing my critique process with you. I look at three main areas: Design, Functionality, and Responsiveness. To me, these are the three top level keys to modern design and development. I'll go through the site and point out what is working and what is not.</p>
              <p>My plan is that this will kick off a series of videos that show the entire redesign process from start to finish. Keep tuned for those.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I'm over 40 and have been learning web design and development for about 20 years. The Web itself is only 30 years old. I won't say that I've been anything special in the field, just an early adopter. But that early adoption means that I've gained a lot of experience handling the core languages and seen a lot of the different trends along the way.</p>
              <p>But I'm old. At least in the eyes of many out there. Especially hiring managers.</p>
              <p>As we go along we'll find that more and more developers and designers are going to be "old" in the coming decade. That leads to a lot of questions from startups and among the community of developers who still want to do amazing, cutting edge work. Here are the things that seem to be the most troublesome:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Older developers' bodies are slowing down.</strong> The reality is that as you get older so does your body. That includes your brain. I was speaking with another programmer about this. He's learning a lot of new languages at the same time. He believes that his younger self would have picked it up more quickly than his middle-aged self. As you get older you just need more time to process things. The upside is that you have become a more efficient learner. When you're young you use your energy to push through your mistakes (and you make a lot of mistakes because of your inexperience). However, the older you are the fewer mistakes you make because you know which paths to go down and which to avoid. This creates an efficiency that allows you to still compete.</li>
                <li><strong>Older developers have families and responsibilities.</strong> Most people are waiting until their late 20's (sometimes longer) to start a family. This means that a lot of the competition for jobs in this industry are going to young people with no attachments and few responsibilities. There is also a tendency to move from their homes to places like Silicon Valley or Austin to seek out good jobs in tech. It's not really a surprise that companies are places where "fitting in" is a really big deal. This is where a lot of your relationships will be formed. For older developers who already have families, the bean bag and ping pong workplace just isn't that important because we have people and responsibilities at home. This is just what happens as you get older. There are always corporations who are ready to give those older developers a good, steady job that allows them to support their families and be able to prioritize those responsiblities. The drawback is that the work you do is pretty safe and conservative. Few corporations are pushing the limits with what they're doing. That trade-off can be too much for some developers and they seek the startup/agency life which puts them back into the companies with bean bags and energy drink induced all night hackathons. It's just a weird place to be as an older developer because the market hasn't created a space that is vibrant in the kinds of projects you work on and grown up in employment.</li>
                <li><strong>Older developers have wisdom and experience.</strong> The one thing that continues to grow as you age, even as things slow down, is your wisdom and experience. Older developers and programmers should be thought of like bonds. Keep them around to age and mature and it will pay dividends in the future. When you've worked in a field for 20 years or more you've seen just about all there is. When the field is as old as the people working in it then they've literally seen everything. Why wouldn't a company want that sort of experience on their team? One issue is money. That experience and wisdom is worth something. Maybe worth more than companies are willing to spend. This could certainly be another hurdle for a seasoned developer in working with startups and small agencies. I would hope that companies and agencies begin to see that one older developer could be worth two younger, less skilled developers. Or that bringing in one veteran developer to a group of young developers (assuming the older developer is concerned with teaching and guiding) could actual grow the team faster in terms of their skills and outputs. This doesn't necessarily have to be a senior role but could be. Depends on the developer.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I'm sure there are a lot more issues. If you know of some leave them as a comment on the Twitter card below.</p>

              <p>Here's an accessible, easy-to-implement FAQ pattern that doesn't use JavaScript. It's one of my favorites.</p>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>The key to this FAQ is the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag in HTML 5.2. There are a couple of notable parts to this. First, the FAQ group should go into the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element. That's essentially your wrapper. Inside that wrapper element there is a <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element. That is where you put the text or icon that the user clicks. In our case it is the question for the FAQ. The final element in the group is the content that is hidden and shows on click. This can be anything you can put into HTML (text, video, audio, images, etc.) so go crazy with it. Note that anything in the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> wrapper that is after the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element will be hidden until <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> is clicked. This allows for multiple paragraphs or elments.</p>
              <p>It's also possible to do some basic animations using CSS. I've put those in the example, too, just to show some of the things that are possible.</p>

              <p>It's no secret that developing websites for mobile is important. There are some usability patterns that really help users when they visit your website. They're little touches that create delight for the user. The awesome part is that many of these moments of delight are really easy to implement.</p>
              <p>One of the things I love is when I don't have to click to focus in on the first input of a form or signup page. This is a very nice touch for mobile users and requires only one word in the first input. You simply write <code>autofocus</code> as an attribute of the input you want to focus on page load. Here's a pen that shows what it's like when you have autofocus and without. You can see the attribute in the first form's email input.</p>

              <p>You can <a href="https://s.codepen.io/brianhaferkamp/debug/zVEZZJ" target="_blank">see the forms in action by viewing the demo here</a>. The two forms in the demo are exactly the same except for one word. Notice the top email address focuses on page load while the bottom input doesn't. To get the full effect, check it out on your mobile device.</p>
              <p>This pattern is best for a page where the primary first step for the user is going to be the input. Consider it for login/signup pages, especially.</p>

              <p>We are at the cusp of another step in the evolution (de-evolution?) of the Internet and the World Wide Web. What was once a global sharing system primarily used for communication is growing up into an all-encompassing virtual world. At the beginning, we used terms like <i>site</i> or <i>home</i> to represent the things we built in this virtual land grab. Now those metaphors are becoming a reality. This virtual world will (most likely) be a home for many. There are many implications of this for being human, but that is a digression.</p>
              <p>I'm certainly not obsessed with the future. I think I will see major systemic change in the next two decades (provided I make it that long) as the world begins to embrace virtual and augmented reality. These are the next evolution of the Internet and the Web. Up to this point, we have been outside the Matrix looking in but eventually we will be inside it&mdash;part of it. Are you ready Player One?</p>
              <p>I work in a retail industry&mdash;books to be specific. A lot has changed before I got into it and the advent of digital books themselves has upended the entire industry. I believe the coming wave of AR and VR will send it all into a tailspin. Publishing houses have gone from printers to media firms and will have to make a new shift into experience houses. They are the places where the best stories can be told. They are the ones who have made fictions real in the heads of trillions over the last 200 years. With that ability to tell and share stories they have first crack at building the stories that so many will live in over the next 50-100 years. The Century of the Story is upon us and they are the holders of the stories so many people love. It will be interesting.</p>
              <p>But publishers also sell books&mdash;at least they sell stories and content that were formerly only published as books. I think that book publishing will continue into the near future but there will be a whole other world in which story content is consumed in a hundred other ways.</p>
              <p>One of the "here and now" things that I think about is the future of retail. What will it look like when augmented reality becomes common? With access to the physical and virtual realities at the same time, how will shopping change? I think it presents some really exciting things for the future. I can shop in a physical store but have access to a company's entire stock through the digital. I know that this exists now in the form of our phones but in the future the transition from physical to digital will be more seamless&mdash;possibly more human, if you can imagine.</p>
              <p>Yesterday I set out to simulate a shopping experience that might happen in the near future. This is my own version of what book shopping might look like for my company in the not so distant future. The experience is based on voice commands and some sort of wearable heads up display. This is just a prototype and a simulation. I'm sure commercial versions of this will be slicker, but it's a start. I think we need a vision for what the experience could be. Here is a video taking you through the prototype:</p>

              <p>I created the prototype that I used in the video in Adobe XD. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/dd2a36fc-1536-47ca-5162-f038aef5cfea-ab1b/" target="_blank">Try out the prototype here</a>.</p>
              <p>I'm curious to know what others think of the future. Leave a comment on Twitter by clicking the card below and replying to the tweet.</p>

              <p>This is a really great effect that you can use with just CSS. Apply a crossfade that places two images on top of one another. Play with the slider to give one image more or less transparency in relation to the other. To make for a smooth transition, choose two images that are the same size. Otherwise you get a weird resizing things. I'm not sure what this could ever be used for but maybe you could animate it using JavaScript? Maybe some cool possibilities there.</p>

            <section class="stories-image">

            </section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Today I want to share some of my criteria for critiquing website designs. This does not have to do with code or interactions but the visual design itself. As most projects begin with some sort of visual design or elements, it's a good checklist to have.</p>
              <h4>Using words instead of visuals</h4>
              <p>Are you using words to say something that could be said with a visual? If so, then consider dropping the words and replacing the text with something visual, like a video, photo, infographic, or icon. According to this <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3035856/why-were-more-likely-to-remember-content-with-images-and-video-infogr" target="_blank">Fast Company article on visual content and memory</a>, "visuals are processed 60,000 times faster than text."</p>
              <h4>Readability</h4>
              <p>Can the text be read easily? I'm looking at things like line length (how many words per line) and legibility (can you read the text over background colors or images) This is a little different than contrast. You want to make sure the text and buttons pop off of backgrounds. If the background is busy, consider a blur or darker color overlay.</p>
              <h4>Fonts</h4>
              <p>The right font can make or break a design. There is a reason that we have so many fonts to choose from. The main thing I want to know about the font is whether or not it's the right choice for the site/app. You know this by figuring out the target market for the product. For instance, Black letter or a Gothic script font is probably not the right choice for a mommy blog. The more mainstream your product or service, the more you will need to choose a rather bland font. Something strong and sans-serif works well when your audience is diverse.</p>
              <p>The other thing I look at are font combinations. Do they work together? Are they both speaking the same thing to the same audience? If you're not confident in font pairings, consider looking to a site like <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/" target="_blank">typewolf.com, where you can learn all about fonts, pairings, and recommendations</a>. Don't have the eye for font pairings, stick with one font family and work with different sizes and weights from that one family. It brings a sense of cohesion to the design when you do that. Check out this <a href="https://design.google/library/choosing-web-fonts-beginners-guide/" target="_blank">a step-by-step guide for choosing fonts for the web</a> from Google.</p>
              <p>You might also consider a super family that might have both serif and sans-serif fonts. Here are some examples of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/featured/Superfamilies" target="_blank">super families on Google Fonts</a> that you can easily incorporate into a website.</p>
              <h4>Colors</h4>
              <p>The last major category is color. Things I'm looking at are appropriateness to the product and target audience and contrast/legibility.</p>
              <p>There is actually a lot in the concept of appropriateness. If your product is only going to be consumed by the people of one country you need to know what those people grow up thinking about certain colors. Red in one country might not mean the same thing in other countries. One good example is seeing a person's name in red ink in Korea means that the person is deceased or (if living) that you wish them dead. That's probably not what you're going for in your design so if the audience is global, make sure you're not offending with the color choices you're making.</p>
              <p>Another major consideration is contrast. Do the colors you choose (especially for text) have enough contrast for the Web? In print, there are some things you can get away with, but when you build things online you have no control of the output for each user. Therefore, you need to follow some standard design rules. To check whether or not your colors have enough contrast you can use <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">a tool like the color contrast checker from WebAIM</a>. It allows you to input your foreground and background colors and check the contrast levels. Passing the AA level (4.5:1) is a good start. If you can pass on the AAA level (7:1) then you're doing great. You might find that this cramps your design aesthetic, but you're probably just going to have to change the way you think between the Web and print. It's not the same thing.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, this gives you a nice framework for critiquing website designs. The Web is not print. We have no control of the outputs where our work will be shown. So use the tools referenced above and you'll start to understand why websites look the way they do and begin to work within those boundaries to create amazing designs of your own.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I'm often amazed at the things we can do now in CSS. Here is another example. We can now use <code>position: sticky</code> to create sticky elements on the page. When combined with the knowledge that the elements only stay sticky within the height of their containers, we can create awesome and easy effects like this one where the headers for each section stick until the user scrolls to the next section. This used to be done with JavaScript and removing the element from the flow of the HTML document. Now, the element acts both relatively and absolutely positioned. It's cool. Check out the code below or watch the video above.</p>

              <p>As web developers, we use a lot of tools. Most people with a craft do. So here are some of my favorite tools to use.</p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" target="_blank">
                <h4>Adobe XD</h4></a>
              <p>My work team has adopted Adobe XD for all of our design work. I love its simplicity and that we can create interactive mockups that can be shared on the Web. Animations, vectors, and more make this program an amazing addition. Photoshop and Illustrator work well, but they aren't necessarily made for what we do. XD hits all the right notes for a web developer.</p><a href="https://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm" target="_blank">
                <h4>FastStone Image Viewer</h4></a>
              <p>This little Windows program is an essential part of my image editing workflow. When Lightroom or Photoshop are too heavy I turn to FastStone Image Viewer to do light editing. I also use the screenshot tool all the time to grab images of whole windows or specific areas. It opens quickly and does all the little jobs perfectly.</p><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">
                <h4>Atom</h4></a>
              <p>I've been using Atom as my code editor for years. I love that it's open source, configurable, and really lightweight. It's got all the basics plus people write plugins for specific libraries and languages. It also connects very easily to Github so you can push and pull right from Atom. Slick.</p><a href="https://github.com/brianhaferkamp/20-mile-head-start" target="_blank">
                <h4>My Typical Stack</h4></a>
              <p>About half of our projects at work are WordPress and the other half use my typical stack: PugJS, SASS, jQuery, BrowserSync, Gulp. It's a node-based workflow that I've added to over the years to get up and running quickly. It includes a material design icon font.</p>
              <p>I call my build system, The 20-Mile Head Start, because if building a site were a marathon, this system is like being driven to mile 20 and then starting the race. It saves so much time in setup and all you need to get going is node.js.</p><a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">
                <h4>WordPress</h4></a>
              <p>When I reach for a CMS it's always WordPress. The community is so large, the resources plentiful, and PHP is easy to work with. It's a no-brainer. That said, I try to steer our projects away from a CMS unless completely necessary. There is some maintenance work that must go into WordPress so building with it means maintaining it for the long haul. That's something I try to keep in mind in recommending a stack for each project.</p><a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">
                <h4>Webflow</h4></a>
              <p>I've just started to get into Webflow over the past year. It's not what I thought it was--in a good way. I thought it would be a Wix-type editor, but that's not the concept. Webflow is a visual text editor. That's the best way to describe it. There aren't a lot of prebuilt components out of the box that you simply drag and drop into a site. Rather, it is a visual way to write code. If you take that thought into it I think it will make more sense. It also makes it enjoyable for web developers to use who already know how to code. This is no little sweet cupcake of a website; it is a full development program. Kudos to the Webflow team.</p>
              <p>FYI, the ease of creating relatively sophisticated JavaScript interactions has almost made me switch to it exclusively.</p>
              <p>That's certainly not all of the tools in my toolbox. I've left out lots of good ones (for instance, <a href="http://jslint.com/" target="_blank">jslint.com</a> and these <a href="https://codepen.io/sdthornton/pen/wBZdXq" target="_blank">material design shadows</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a>). But these are the main tools I use on a daily basis. If they might be helpful to you, check them out and give them a try.</p>
              <p>What are some of your favorite tools to use for web development?</p>

              <p>In this video, I delve into responsive images for the Web. In days past we were only able to serve one image for the <code>img</code> element. However, with HTML5, we were given the <code>picture</code> element. It allows us to serve multiple images with the same HTML element and to do so at predetermined viewport widths.</p>
              <p>The video covers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Art direction for images (how to crop images for different sizes)</li>
                <li>Saving images for the Web (the visual quality of the image)</li>
                <li>Writing the HTML so that different viewport sizes receive different images</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Here is the code on Codepen if you just want to get right to the HTML or follow along with the video.</p>
              <div class="stories-image">
                <div class="pen"><p class="codepen" data-height="600" data-theme-id="26191" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="brianhaferkamp" data-slug-hash="QXEELo" style="height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Responsive Images">

              <p>Why is all of this important? It is a user-centered approach. Serving one image for all screens is not ideal because small devices are usually on data networks or Wi-Fi, which are inherently slower than Ethernet connections. Small devices also have less processing power than desktop or laptop computers. This all means users experience slower loading times and use more bandwidth (i.e., data) for no particular reason.</p>
              <p>A really cool advantage of this technique is you get to direct how users see images at certain screen sizes. If you serve one image that looks great on a large desktop it might not look as good on a mobile phone. Some of the details will be lost because the image is shrinking to a smaller overall size. Using the technique in the pen above, you can crop an image differently for different sized devices to show the user exactly what you want them to focus on in the image.</p>
              <p>Use this really easy technique to serve appropriate images to your users.</p>

              <p>I consider myself lucky to have learned web development when I did in the late 1990s. It was a real wild west so you could make things that weren't that sophisticated and you were considered a success. Drop down menus and app-like UIs were pretty crazy. A little CSS could make your site really stand out.</p>
              <p>For people going into web development today, the lines are not so straight. It seems like there are a lot of short cuts to getting to web development. Lots of tools that will help make your life easier&mdash;if you know what you're doing already. That's the tricky part, right? Getting to competency.</p>
              <p>My suggestion to new web developers is to get very proficient at building products on the Web using the baseline languages&mdash;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll probably be surprised at all the things you can build just with that simple setup. The Web is literally built on them. And when you throw in images, video, APIs, etc. there are a lot of products that can be built just with those base languages and concepts. Practice them constantly. When you get to the point that you can't build something in your head then go out and research how to do it with something outside these base languages.</p>
              <p>If you're a new developer, don't skimp on learning the fundamentals. HTML and CSS will take you very far. Basic JavaScript will push you even farther. Always keep in mind that you are building a platform for communicating some message.</p>
              <p>My best example is this humble blog. There is nothing fancy here. I do some pre-processing of the HTML and CSS, but, in the end, the code is simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The important part is always the content. It is on the Web and can potentially affect millions of people. That's a powerful thing. Never lose sight of the fact that the base languages can give you that kind of power.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I consider myself a remote worker. I have three days in an office and two days working remotely.</p>
              <p>Yesterday I video conferenced with a team in India, chatted with my supervisor, completed my work, and spent the day with my wife and kids. I was productive, got paid, and was able to spend time with people I love the most (no offense to my coworkers).</p>
              <p>Over the last two years working remotely has enabled me to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Spend a month in Europe with my family</li>
                <li>Have more time with my family</li>
                <li>Save money on my commute</li>
                <li>Work while traveling in East Asia</li>
                <li>Be a meaningful part of an organization outside my work</li>
                <li>Have flexibility on <i>when</i> I work as well as where</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These are all very life-giving and I'm grateful for the flexibility my job allows. It makes me sad when I hear about situations where people are chained to a desk and a cubicle for no apparent reasons. They are not high level or in meetings constantly.</p>
              <p>I believe that an office is largely about control, not productivity. So many corporations operate in silos that it's a farce to say that it's about productivity. I dare say that many young people are actually using technology to break down the silos whether or not they are present on site. To me, that speaks to the ability of modern communication technologies to bring people together from disparate parts of the company, not drive a wedge between them.</p>
              <p>I've worked as a freelancer and in an agency that was mostly a distributed team (we met together once a week in an office downtown). Both of those experiences were very good for me and I enjoy the freedom that comes from remote work. I think that's really it: freedom. It's not that I'm bucking against the control of the office, it's just that I mostly don't see the point in being forced to be together with people you can't get to know (because of the silos, departments, cubicles, walls, etc.) doing work that could be done in another place.</p>
              <p>Most of the objections to remote work revolve around not knowing if employees are really working or not. This fear is just a control mechanism to keep it all moving the way it's always been. There are so many ways to know if an employee is working or not. Foremost is the work itself. Is it getting done? Then the person is working. With phones, texting, email, video chat, IM, and more there really is no excuse not to give people the freedom to be in the place they want to be to do their work.</p>
              <p>Remote work means there must be new processes for accountability that need to be put into place. Managers need to learn to deal with both the work and the employee. There is an amount of emotional intelligence that must be in place because one of the parties (the employee) can no longer be controlled the same. Our metrics for a successful employee need to change from time-based to quality-based. An employee might be only working 4-6 hours a day but still producing as much as someone working an 8-hour day. When you can't "see" productivity (which just means the person is at the desk working when a manager walks by) you have to gauge it a different way. The quality of the work and whether or not the employee is hitting the "normal" production levels are the metrics for success for remote workers.</p>
              <p>Now that I've said polarizing things, I'll bring it back to the middle. Remote work is appropriate for employees doing conceptual work or digital work (designers, programmers, developers, marketers, et al.). There are still many positions that require physical presence. Sometimes conceptual positions can also benefit from physical presence, too.</p>
              <p>How do you feel about remote work? Like it? Is it the future of all things? I'm interested to hear what you think.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Have you ever had a short piece of content sandwiched between a header and footer that just doesn't take up enough space to force the footer all the way to the bottom of the browser window? This happens to me all the time on redirect pages after form submissions. Here's how it looks:</p>
              <div class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/thank-you-page-example.jpg" alt="An example thank you page with a standard header and footer but not enough content in the middle to push the footer to the bottom of the browser window."/></div>
              <p>What we want to do is push the footer to the bottom. We could use fixed positioning:</p>
              <p><code><pre>footer {position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;}</pre></code></p>
              <p>This is the look that we are going for but doing this takes the footer out of the flow of the document and could mess things up for us later on. Here's how it looks:</p>
              <div class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/thank-you-example-fixed.jpg" alt="Showing our thank you page with the CSS position: fixed property applied"/></div>
              <p>We could also try: <code><pre>footer {min-height: 100vh;}</pre></code></p>
              <p>That does the trick, but it's a little brute force for my taste. It also pushes the footer past the bottom of the browser's bottom edge. This is what it looks like:</p>
              <div class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/thank-you-example-min-height.jpg" alt="Showing our thank you page with the CSS min-height applied"/></div>
              <p>Okay, now let's get to a better solution. I've found that the best way to do this is to use CSS Grid Layout. First, we apply Grid to our <code>body</code> element:</p>
              <p><code><pre>body {display: grid; grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;}</pre></code></p>
              <p>This code alone doesn't do anything, but it gives us the framework for the magic to happen. To make the content section take up all the available space, we need to add in a minimum height for the grid we just made. This will make it stretch from the top of the viewport to the bottom of the viewport even if there is not enough content. Here's the code with the <code>min-height</code> property applied to the grid:</p>
              <p><code><pre>body {display: grid; grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto; min-height: 100vh;}</pre></code></p>
              <p>Notice that we are explicitly giving values to the three rows of our grid. The first and last are <code>auto</code> which means the elements will take up whatever space they require. The middle value represents our content section. That should take up all of the remaining space. We do that with the <code>1fr</code> value. Voila! You have a relatively positioned grid that takes up all of the viewport's height at the very least. It will also continue to allow the main content section to grow if you put a lot of content in there and it pushes everything down. The <i>minimum</i> height is 100vh, so it will continue to grow as content pushes the elements down the page past the bottom of the browser window.</p>
              <p>To center everything, just add this to the main content section:</p>
              <p><code><pre>#content {place-self: center;}</pre></code></p>
              <div class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/thank-you-example-final.jpg" alt="Showing the final version of our thank you page with the centered text"/></div>
              <p>We now have center-aligned (vertically and horizontally) content inside a main content section that pushes our footer to the bottom of the browser window and doesn't mess up the flow of the document to do it.</p>

              <p>In this video I show you how to create a sticky header using the <code>{position: sticky}</code> CSS property. What I love about the sticky property is that it keeps the element in the flow of the document. Normally, we use a <code>{position: fixed}</code> to stick an element. This is great but it causes problems with the elements around it. Using <code>{position: sticky}</code> we no longer have to configure padding and margin for elements around the sticky element. It all just sort of works. The only downside is IE and Edge support. But this is a progressive enhancement. In those browsers the element just won't be sticky. You could use <code>@supports</code> to create a feature query for browsers that can utilize the sticky property and then create fixed position on the element for browsers to fall back on.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Getting motivated to write code can sometimes be a chore. For me, the hard parts are at the beginning of projects I don't want to do or the middle of projects I've already started. When I have something I'm excited to start working on it's easy to take off and start coding. Getting a project through the middle stages, however, is more difficult for me. I'm a stage one rocket developer, I guess.</p>
              <p>One thing that has really helped over the years is developing a work groove. I just made that up. There must be a technical name for that. What I mean is that I sit in the same chair, have a routine, and even have "work" music. If I want to get stuff done I have playlists that help me focus in on writing code. The playlists go in cycles for me, but usually it's metal and hard rock. Here are my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1F_FqSgqwHngzPiVn2DB4EE" target="_blank">Rock Favorites</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1Fnr2wQHzxCc4VsMvOlbvhF" target="_blank">Blindside</a>, one of my favorite Swedish metal bands of all time. Sometimes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1F72ivGtPcPc8UfyfJn3qtU" target="_blank">Twenty One Pilots</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1Fx_QpQ5gDKAMszzP8GBqVM" target="_blank">Switchfoot</a> does the trick, too. It's as though my brain knows when certain music comes on that it's time to write code.</p>
              <p>Here are some things you can do to find your own groove.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Set a consistent place to work.</b> It might take working in a couple of spots to find your ideal work environment. Once you find it, do it every time. I sit in the same chair on the same side of the table each day. My desk stays arranged the same way at the office, too.</li>
                <li><b>Set a consistent time to work.</b> It's important to have your body know it's work time. Train it by working a consistent schedule. This is easier for company work and harder if you're a freelancer or work from home. On my work from home days I try to keep the same schedule as my office days. If you're a remote worker identify your rhythms. Are you most alert in the morning, middle of the day, or at night. If you can adjust your coding time to these periods of the day your time in the code might be more productive and enjoyable.</li>
                <li><b>Create a pre-work ritual or routine.</b> What rituals do you do to signal your brain that it's about to enter work mode? For me, I get up at 5am and take time to think, read, and meditate. Then shower and either get ready to drive to the office or sit down to code. Last thing I do before I turn on the computer is get a cup of coffee. This routine let's my body know it's time to transition to thinking about writing code.</li>
                <li><b>Find out what blocks out distractions for you.</b> For me, it's the right music. Static/white noise, traffic, looking at a particular coffee shop mural, silence. Whatever you need around you to get yourself focused, find it and do it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In the beginning it will take some time to figure these things out for yourself. Try something. If it doesn't work try something else. Make note of when you're most productive.</p>
              <p>Web development is a job full of repetition and routine. Becoming a creature of habit will help your brain and body get into the groove.</p>

              <p>I tend to live with the belief that the Web is the future of web development. Call me crazy. But it doesn't always seem that way. There are many companies that would love to create the platform that kills the Web and takes away market/attention share. It's like trying to recreate the solar system inside the already existent one and asking people to come inside. At some point the people will realize that it's just a small, fake recreation that only fills the needs of some. They will want more.</p>
              <p>So the future is the open Web.</p>
              <p>These are seemingly elementary thoughts but important ones. I'm trying to think education over the next 10 years. What will devs need to know? Where should they be developing their skills right now? Who is pushing the ball into the next decade of development and design?</p>
              <p>I hope to get to some of those answers and incorporate them into the dev education platform I'm building. Right now, I think the important thing is that we educate new web developers who are well-versed in the fundamentals of the Web languages (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) so that they will be nimble enough to build on that foundation to create whatever is coming. I'm thinking, especially, of the coming VR/AR, AI, and IoT revolutions. I don't know <i>how</i> we'll build those things but I do know it's coming at us quickly.</p>
              <p>What do you think developers should be focusing on for the next 10 years?</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">Banded Features Section Using CSS Grid</h3>
            <section class="stories-image"></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I was working on a design yesterday to practice my Adobe XD skills and work out an idea for a business template. I created an interesting features section that relies on some overlapping elements. You can see them here:</p>
              <div class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/overlapping-features-section.jpg"/></div>
              <p>I haven't really thought about the challenge of coding such an element. This is a common part of designing for the Web. Designers often don't understand all the limitations of the code. Over the past year many of those previous limitations have been taken away through the combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout in CSS. Many of the things that designers can do in an image editing program developers are able to do in the code.</p>
              <p>Here is the workup of the features section in a CodePen pen:</p>
              <div class="stories-image">
                <div class="pen"><p class="codepen" data-height="600" data-theme-id="26191" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="brianhaferkamp" data-slug-hash="WBBwjg" style="height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Banded Features Section">

<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>A couple of things to notice are the use of the <code>transform: scale()</code> property on the image. This gives us the illusion of the overlapping without needing to fiddle with the size properties of the image. Since the scaling is very small it shouldn't distort the image.</p>
              <p>The other thing I wanted to point out is the use of CSS Grid to control the layout of each features section. Grid makes it really easy to create an inverted section. Just change the way the elements are laid out using a particular class. It's not difficult.</p>
              <p>What I want to do with design ideas like this is to show how far we can go now with CSS Grid. The designs that we sent back to designers to change are now easily achievable. Let's go out and make the Web beautiful!</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">Web Dev Education Platform Progress Update</h3>
            <section class="stories-image"></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Today I want to share an update on a new web development education channel. The channel will be a video channel for learning web development with video lessons curated from YouTube. I know that a lot of people learn really well from bloggers writing out their processes. That's never been the way I learn best. When I want to learn some new things, I usually hop over to YouTube and try to find a video. This is especially useful for learning large, general concepts that I can apply in other places.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwvLFLe1xjQO9v7uPxKAnQ" target="_blank">I have been using YouTube to teach web development</a> since about 2014. I find it to be a really great medium to learn and to connect with others. Almost 5,000 subscribers later, I think others are finding it useful, too.</p>
              <p>This idea for a dedicated web development channel is coming from the public television idea. Create a space where you can showcase the best teachers who are already creating individual "shows" and put them all in the same place. The quality of the teaching is key, as is the curation of the best content. I'm not trying to reproduce a typical search for a topic on YouTube. Instead, I want to curate the best teachers and resources. Here's a look at the development progress I've made so far:</p>
              <div class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/learnWebDevTV_development-progress.png"/></div>
              <p>I've got the mobile view completed for the home page and for the main HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages. Each of those will be further subdivided and will link off to a grid of videos for each of those subdivisions.</p>
              <p>The goal of the project is to make it easier for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CodeNewbies" target="_blank">#CodeNewbies</a> to discern the best teachers on YouTube. This should lessen frustration and lead to more efficient learning.</p>
              <p>A secondary goal is to give creators and teachers a platform to begin creating content for. There are so many talented developers out there who would do really well at connecting with students. They're not easy to find. It takes a while for people to rise to the top and get enough subscribers to start making money on YouTube. That bar is always being moved, as well. I'd like to try and build a community around a channel in order to expedite the process of introducing new teachers and teaching styles into the education process for developers.</p>
              <p>If Phase 1 is successful and the idea takes hold then I'm really excited about what could be possible in the future. I'll keep you posted on the progress and let you know a launch date. I've had one dev reach out to help and would welcome others. Phase 1 will be pretty basic but I could use all the help I can get to make it successful enough to move on to bigger and better ideas.</p>

            </section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Accessibility has been a concern for users of the Web since the beginning. I've read the statistic that 1 in 5 users of the Web need some sort of assistance when using a browser. That could be as severe as complete blindness all the way to just needing to make the text larger for older eyes. For the beginner dev all the way to the seasoned professional accessibility should be a chief concern for a front end developer. It is one of the things that a Web developer specifically brings to the table every time.</p>
              <p>I want to share some baseline thoughts and resources to help you create better (i.e., more accessible) sites, pages, and apps.</p>
              <p>Here are some practical first steps, or basics, of Web accessibility:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Write semantic markup.</strong> One of the best ways to get started writing more accessible pages is to use appropriate HTML5 markup. Don't use a <code>div</code> when there is a more appropriate semantic tag available. Look over your naked code in HTML (without CSS) and see if there are areas that you can clearly markup as headers, footers, navigation, and so on. Is there a more sensible way to separate the content? Use some (or all) of the resources at the end of this post to see or hear how the site will be accessed through the HTML.</li>
                <li><strong>Allow your visual content to speak.</strong> Visual content is great for sighted users. However, what if images are turned off or the user is unable to see them? There are rock solid ways to let the user know the content of images on the Web. Note that if the image is described in the content itself, or is only there for decoration, no alt text is necessary. Go through your images and determine what visual content needs to be understood and what is on the page simply to make things look good.</li>
                <li><strong>Make forms easier to understand and use.</strong> This is one of the big ones. Forms have been the bane of existence from the beginning but they are very important to the modern Web so you need to know how to use them and use them well. The biggest thing you can do is connect the form label with the input it describes. (And yes, you need to use the <code>label</code> tag for your inputs.) Using a <code>label</code> for your inputs allows the user to tab understandably and will also help screen readers connect labels with the appropriate inputs in a way that can be audibly understood.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the right tags for links.</strong> Links are another big issue. Use an anchor link when the link takes you to another page or off the site completely (an HTTP request) and use a button when the action happens on the same page or view. You get some inherent styling and behavior when you use the right elements. This is one of those instances. If you try to do everything through JavaScript then you're essentially building the behavior back into the element that you could have gotten by just using the right element in the first place. Do the right thing.</li>
                <li><strong>Give interactive elements some space.</strong> This is one that not many people think about. Modern design (think Apple.com) is built on the premise of large type and lots of nice negative (white) space between sections, words, and elements. This is more than a design aesthetic, it's also a practical way to give users with disabilities the opportunity to take the right actions. If the clickable elements are too close together then the odds of clicking the wrong thing go up. Can you click the right element when your hands are shaking? Then there is probably enough space between them. If not, create some space with margins and make the hit areas larger through padding.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>That's only scratching the surface. I promise you, though, that adding these elements in will not only help disabled users but the site or app in general. The bots will also love you and understand your content better which will help boost your search rankings. Devs who come along after you will probably praise you.</p>
              <p>Here are some great resources to get you started:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML" target="_blank">Accessibility on Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://a11yproject.com/" target="_blank">The A11Y Project</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Every small step you take helps take care of the ecosystem of a site or app. It's like picking up a piece of trash on the ground next to a trash can and throwing it away. It seems small but it's the these small (but easy) things that add up over time. Take the time to learn accessibility well and then do it.</p>

              <p>A couple of months ago I created an application called ModSite. The goal is to make it easier for web developers and designers to make the web beautiful. On the left side of the app are different modular layouts that you can literally copy and paste into your next website or app. Simply click on each thumbnail, click the code on the right, and copy it to put it into your page or app. Mix and match the different modules to create unique layouts. The code is open source and free for you to use on any site.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I started out in web development (then only known as web design) back in the 1990s. I have no idea what it's like to start out today. Overwhelming, I imagine. When I started all we had, really, was HTML4. CSS was starting to gain traction around that time but we hadn't even moved into the world of web standards. Browsers were all doing their thing.</p>
              <p>When I look around I even get dizzy with all of the shiny bells and whistles out there fighting for attention. Seems like every week there is something new to pay attention to. And social media has made it all the more distracting. I have to include myself in that. I create lots of little things that I'd like people to pay attention to or use. I think they will be useful. But maybe they are just a major distraction to those who are learning.</p>
              <p>That brings me to the main point: Crawl, walk, run. It takes a while to do all of this so give yourself some time to learn properly. If you set the foundation of your web development learning, it will pay dividends in the future. One of the best reasons to start from the very beginning is that you become a more nimble and flexible developer because you understand how everything works together. That helps you solve problems from a different angle. You can bring your own unique spin to things.</p>
              <p>If you're completely new to web development, I highly encourage you to get HTML5 thoroughly. Learn how to mark up your code for the sake of accessibility. Many devs have to go back to learn this important part because they never learned it to start with. If you know how to write easy-to-read, accessible code it will help you and the user.</p>
              <p>Once you know how to write accessible HTML5 then move onto styling the page with CSS. Write so much CSS that you start to understand what your styles are going to look like before you write them. It helps at this stage to also mix in some basic design knowledge. This includes typography, layout, and color. These are so important to presenting the site in a clear and pleasing way. The idea is that users feel so comfortable with the page that they don't see the design. They only get the information clearly and thoroughly.</p>
              <p>The last step of the beginning dev process is to dive into JavaScript. This is the language of movement on the web. It is what the muscles are to the body. You can get work without learning JavaScript but that is actually not easy to find. Most people want you to have some baseline of knowledge when it comes to JS. JavaScript is a relatively easy language to learn the fundamentals of object oriented programming. It doesn't require any special setup to make it work. Everything is right in the browser for you to get started. There are some great JavaScript resources online for you to use. FreeCodeCamp.org and YouTube are two that I've used in the past.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of people beginning the journey of web development. It can be frustrating. That's part of learning something new. Don't take the shortcut. Just learn the baseline languages and begin to develop more sophistication from there. Get used to searching online for answers. You will need the skills of a researcher and the persistence of a beat reporter to do this work. There is a lot of information out there. Learn how to start with what you know and then begin synthesizing information and keywords into a better search.</p>
              <p>In some ways I envy the devs starting out today. However, starting out in the Wild West of web development meant that I had to deconstruct what others had done and consume the few books available. This made me a better developer and gave me the skills that I still use each day I come to work. I hope that your journey goes well. Get stuck. Break things so you can fix them. Be persistent. Ask questions. These are the keys to learning how to build things on the web.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>The musical, <i>Hamilton</i>, has beautiful production value. It also strikes a very strong emotional chord with the audience. They manage to move the audience through music, the tone of the lyrics, and through the movement of the props and characters on the stage.</p>
              <p>One of the unsung heroes of the entire production is color. Many of the traditional devices of the theater are not present (like curtains) to obstruct or show scene change. Instead, there is a rotating stage and a beautiful presentation of color through light. The use of reds and blues (and even an ocean scene in the beginning) help to tell the story of the internal emotions of the characters. It really is beautiful to watch, as well as a compelling story.</p>
              <p>Lots of times we get caught up in the utility of designing web pages and apps. We are so consumed as developers and designers about the UX of the product that we sometimes forget that we can build emotional experience into our designs and experiences.</p>
              <p>One of the things I notice a lot is becoming a slave to the brand colors. We tell ourselves, "Keep it simple. Not too many colors so that we can highlight what the user is supposed to do." In a world of small devices, small touch points, and low attention span, that is actually a wise thing to do. Using one or two colors is great to clearly delineate where users should click.</p>
              <p>But what about the coming world of VR and AR? I imagine that attention span will be much less of a problem and we will need to focus on designing for experience a lot more. It will be more about moving the user through the fantastical new lens of a new world. How will we engage all of the senses when they are all plugged in and ready to be engaged? What will we use to tell the stories of products and companies so that we give users something to feel and engage with in this new sensory-overloaded world?</p>
              <p>Creating pages that get users to connect emotionally to products and services may not seem important now because there is so much distance between the user and the digital page/app. In the near future, though, it will be a very important skill to have. Practicing now may not yield the types of emotional connections we desire, but I think in the end those who are putting that into practice will be ahead of the curve once user reality goes virtual.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Days like today are the concern I've had about writing a blog. There are so many things to write about and so few hours to write about them. It amounts to writer's block. So here's a mostly blank page talking about the difficulty of writing words about something I know a lot about. Not exactly noteworthy, so I'm sorry if this is a waste of time or a click. I promised more things will come that are worth that click.</p>
              <p>A really smart thing to do would be to write out a list of topics and subtopics that I could write about. That way I always have something to refer back to for ideas and to create balance with the subjects I write about. This is the organizational side of me. I'm good at that, especially for others.</p>
              <p>So far I've taken a very spontaneous route with this blog. I've got some things in my back pocket as far as video tutorials or code that I've written on Codepen. However, I don't want to use those all the time. I'd like this to be a mix of thoughts and code and videos.</p>
              <p>Even though these particular thoughts feel a little empty, maybe they'll help someone realize that it's okay to say something and nothing. It's okay just to get something down on the page with the hope that better thoughts will come tomorrow. That's an important part of coding, writing, even life. Wake up, do your best, let what comes come, and try it all again tomorrow.</p>

              <p>Today, something useful. This small function will set an animation class on any object inside a website section when the user scrolls to that section. We've all seen this pattern where the elements animate in on scroll. It doesn't take much JavaScript for this to happen and you can set it for any element in a section or sub-section.</p>
              <p>I feel like this is one of the more useful pieces of code I've shared. I hope that others can use it, too.</p>

            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/hand-crafted.jpg" alt="A man crafting a piece of hot metal in a metal working shop"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>This is a bit of a self-aware post. I just want to write a bit about this blog.</p>
              <p>The blog is pretty minimal in terms of the UI but it's also being written and uploaded by hand. Writing code from scratch isn't that new for me. At work, I build 20-30% of my sites writing code from scratch. In a volume production environment, though, there are some shortcuts, setups, and frameworks that need to be used to get things out the door in a timely fashion. No need to reinvent the wheel every single time.</p>
              <p>On this blog, though, I wanted something more hand-crafted. So I type each post right into the code editor, insert links by hand, and do all of my own image finding and editing. It feels very 2000s to me. Pre-blogs. Pre-CMS. I like it.</p>
              <P>I find that it gets me into the content. I feel that I own the content and have a lot of freedom to put anything I want into each post. There is a certain pain to writing content in HTML and having to style any new thing I want to put into a post. It makes me think about whether I need it or not. I also find that the manual process of moving files over to Github makes me take an extra pass to make sure everything is the way I want it. I don't like the change/upload/refresh cycle for minor things, especially when I could have saved time and energy by just double checking and proofing the content beforehand.</P>
              <p>I'm also trying to get the conversation going on Twitter by using Twitter embeds for the likes, shares, and comments. Not sure if that's a stupid idea or not. But I figure it could help to spread the blog to others via Twitter. It's possible that a simple share feature is better. We'll have to see.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>An idea has been ruminating in my head for a couple of years. It centers around online education in web development.</p>
              <p>My background is that I'm a self-taught developer. I learned HTML and CSS at the same time I was working on my undergraduate degree. That was back in 1997. I picked up <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/html-for-dummies-1st-edition_ed-tittel_steve-james/8830121/#isbn=1568846479&idiq=1838342" target="_blank"><i>HTML for Dummies</i></a> and used my free <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/geocities-dies-in-march-2019-and-with-it-a-piece-of-internet-history/" target="_blank">Geocities</a> account to mark up the files and get them online. It was the wild west, for sure. I loved the idea of publishing work online and here was the platform to do it.</p>
              <p>I say that because I have an affinity for self-taught developers and designers. It says something when a person says, "I want <i>that</i>," and then goes for it.</p>
              <p>The beauty of today is that it is possible to do so without even buying a book. All you need is a basic computer and an internet connection. With tools like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, the classroom has shifted from the trade school or university to the living room or dining room.</p>
              <p>The idea I have is for a video-based channel that brings together the best online video teachers from YouTube to share their knowledge of languages, methodologies, lifestyle, and techniques to the people of the world in an effort to raise up the next generation of web developers&mdash;all for free.</p>
              <p>I'm personally involved in teaching online through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwvLFLe1xjQO9v7uPxKAnQ" target="_blank">my YouTube tutorials</a>. I've been doing that since about 2014 or so. I usually use YouTube to level up my own skills, even for what I'm doing at work. I know there are millions of others who are visual learners like that and would benefit from bringing together teaching on different subjects and languages.</p>
              <p>Phase 1 is to start with the basics&mdash;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll focus on basic understanding and usage, as well as throwing in some new standards, like CSS Grid Layout, Flexbox, and ES6.</p>
              <p>Phase 2 will bring in more personality. We will try to branch out from code and into coding life. So many people are working remotely or in other countries that it is beneficial to hear their voices. We'll also begin to focus in on the business of web development. How do you get jobs? How do you price your work? How do you get work remotely? There are lots of topics there.</p>
              <p>Phase 3 is original programming. That's...well, that's a dream right now.</p>
              <p>Here are a couple of screenshots of the design so far. You can also <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/abee3acb-8a38-4931-4a7d-feb82abec5ae-dddf/" target="_blank">see the mockups online</a>. Feel free to leave a comment.</p>

              <p>I want the UI to be simple for the sake of clarity and loading speed. There are a lot of videos on here. I'll hook into the YouTube API to bring in the videos and featured channels. I'm not sure when this will be live. I'm hoping to get a prototype live by this summer.</p>

            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I get caught in a fight between the utility of the Web and the beauty of it. I want to make things beautiful and hand crafted, but we always have to remember the limitations of the current wave of mobile devices.</p>
              <p>Art direction for the Web is a real thing with the advent of CSS Grid and Flexbox. We now have strong control of the way elements can be laid out on the Web. However, I sometimes get disheartened by the need for utility on the Web because of how many people are accessing our sites and apps via current mobile devices. We have all the ability in the world to create Ferarris but everyone is driving a Smart Car.</p>
              <p>What helps me to continue pushing forward with these ideas is that the mobile future is wearable. One day we'll all put our smart phones down and put on a pair of glasses that overlays the world with all of the beautiful things we can create. Reality will probably be much different this vision, but I can dream, right?</p>
              <p>When this future comes, we'll be able to art direct all of the digital artifacts&mdash;beautiful virtual magazines and newspapers!&mdash;that we create and people will actually be able to notice the beauty of the Web over its utility. I'm thankful for where we are right now, but I'm tired of the internal tug of war. I'm ready for awesome layouts to mean something. I'm tired of stacking boxes.</p>

              <p>Centering things in front end development has often been a pain in the neck over the years. However, advances in CSS3 over the past several years make centering kind of a breeze. (Don't tell that to the designers, though). Here is a pen showing you how to do the most obvious forms of CSS centering, from the easy <code>text-align</code> property to the more challenging ordeal of centering an absolute positioned element. Uncomment the CSS snippets to see the <code>.child</code> element move in real time. Oh, browser sync, we love you.</p>

            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/ghosted.jpg" alt="A man sitting cross-legged on a park bench seemingly unaware there is a ghost standing behind him"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>In the past month I've been ghosted by two clients.</p>
              <p>I guess I don't mind it so much. It's a part of dealing with lower end clients. Well, freelance projects, in general.</p>
              <p>The thing that bothers me about it is that I don't get a chance to talk through the objections. They don't even say, "Hey! That's way too much money. How can you charge that??" I could at least answer that and get into a money talk with them.</p>
              <p>I'm not looking for a lot. Just a "no, thanks" or "I saw your proposal and it's not a good fit." Something like that.</p>
              <P>I watch a lot of videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSkoolRocks" target="_blank">The Futur</a> on YouTube. They share content for creative professionals on handling clients and more of the business/psychology side of being a creative in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/J6Su5Vx3x5U" target="_blank">(Here's a particularly good stream on pricing creative work.)</a></P>
              <p>They suggest having the money talk very early on. From my experiences above, it seems like the best course of action. Between the lead call and proposal I spend a couple of hours that don't get recouped at all. At least a critique of my process or proposal would be worth the time I put into it. It could help me get better.</p>
              <p>If you're a freelancer, have you had similar experiences with clients? Is it something that is getting more or less prevalent? If you've been able to find a way around it, please share.</p>
              <p>I'd love to hear your experiences. Click on the tweet below to share with the Scraps of Code community.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">A Brief Apology for jQuery</h3>
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/jquery.jpg" alt="Books about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery sitting on a shelf next to a cactus"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I would consider myself a hybrid designer/developer. Development skills are what puts money into the bank account but I am a designer at heart. I started learning JavaScript back in the early 2000s, long before it was "everywhere." Back then I understood the object oriented programming concepts but JavaScript just didn't click like HTML and CSS. So I would get frustrated and go back to design and UI.</p>
              <p>When I started working in web development I needed to get some everyday JavaScript under my belt so I could just do the expected levels of interaction on a given website. (There is an expected level.) So I started watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">DevTips</a> videos where <a href="http://travisneilson.com/" target="_blank">Travis Neilson</a> was showing how to work with jQuery. (Here's a good playlist to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt49y1gm0jw&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KOekRWjjajinzlRK879Ksn" target="_blank">learn jQuery in 15 minutes</a>.) Mostly it was just the basics of how to use it and what you can do with it. Being a designer-developer, Travis' videos were perfect for me. I felt that we spoke the same language. So I started working with jQuery almost exclusively (although now I know how to convert things back and forth to vanilla JS, when necessary).</p>
              <p>For years now people have tried to get away from jQuery because it's an extra 30kb download (30kb...for shame!). I mean, seriously, the average web page is over 2mb. I don't really want to hear talk about an extra 30kb.</p>
              <p>For me, jQuery represents a bridge to JavaScript, much like Algebra is a bridge to higher level mathematics for many. jQuery uses real words. It shortens things up so you can just use a method to do things. It makes my code more readable. Essentially, it's designer speak not developer speak.</p>
              <p>I'm sticking with jQuery.</p>

One of the first APIs I started working with is the <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers" target="_blank">Unsplash API</a>. You get access to almost 1 million free to use (for any purpose) images and the API is very well documented. I highly encourage it as a starting point if you're new to APIs. In fact, I created this video as an introduction to using APIs to get data for your website or web app. Once you're finished watching, I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caRGl-IucCQ&list=PLMklnyuK-t1EM3dv5MYD30oAKJijvSxJd" target="_blank">YouTube playlist of several other videos focusing on developing applications with APIs</a>.</p>

              <p>Today I wanted to share a bit of code I created back in 2017. It's a very basic portfolio filtering system using jQuery hide/show to add and remove classes on click. I can't imagine it would be difficult to add some basic animations, like fade in/out.</p>
              <p>The reason I made this was to see how far down I could boil a filtering system for a portfolio. Sometimes a simple solution is all I need. Though there are a lot of plugins available, I needed something simple that just works right out of the box.</p>
              <p>The grid is created using CSS Grid Layout and is fully responsive. Feel free to use it in any of your projects.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">Listening for Appropriate Solutions</h3>
            <!-- h3.stories-group-subheadline-->
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/woman-listening.jpg" alt="One woman talking and one woman listening next to a laptop computer"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>One of the struggles of any profession is providing appropriate solutions to problems. The old adage is, "To a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Web developers are no different. For the JavaScript specialist, everything can be fixed with JS. For the PHP developer, everything can be solved with databases and PHP. But what if the needs of the client are not conducive to your primary skill set? This is where the challenge comes in. Do you continue forward knowing that what you're going to build is a lot more complicated than the client needs? Or will you convey to the client they need something else then refer them to someone who can more appropriately handle his/her needs? Maybe you choose a third way and build what is appropriate but with secondary or tertiary skills. That's an option, too.</p>
              <p>One way to help clients is to listen to them and ask them questions that help determine an appropriate path. Do they just need something small and lightweight that won't be changing anytime soon? Perhaps a standard HTML landing page is the best way to go. Do they need a little more but not quite a full-blown system that needs to be managed? Look into a larger HTML site but using something like <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> to manage it. Does the client think he/she needs a small site when he/she really needs a fully managed CMS? Then explain how a management system can make the client's life easier. You are the consultant. You are fluent in Web things. Your expertise matters here at the front end of the project.</p>
              <p>The problem with doing everything one way for all clients is that you put the client in a bad position. In doing this the developer is not looking out for the client. Instead, he/she is pushing his/her own system onto the client and ignoring the consequences that the client will have to live with. This started happening several years ago when devs began building so many sites with WordPress. The reality is that most clients don't need that level of sophistication. They just need a brochure site. WordPress is a system, though. A great system for creating dynamic content, but not a great system for creating sites that should just be static HTML. So it was an inappropriate build for many clients, but it was done because there were devs who could build the sites that way and clients who were being educated poorly about what they needed.</p>
              <p>So here's a solution. Listen to the client. Determine the most appropriate development solution/stack/platform and then either deliver that out of your own knowledge or begin to create a network of other devs/agencies that you can pass clients along to who specialize in the work the client needs. Consider setting up a small finders fee, if the person/agency is willing. It would be better to make a client happy because you listened to him/her and provided an appropriate solution. Burdening the client with the responsibilities of a printing press when all he/she needed was a printer is irresponsible and short-sighted. Let's do better.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">What is a Website?</h3>
            <h3 class="stories-group-subheadline">Thoughts on understanding the value of a website</h3>
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/client-consultation.jpg" alt="Three people sitting across the table from one another talking"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I sometimes have freelance clients who want me to build a website for them. Often, they are small businesses or solopreneurs. Many of them have no idea about websites or apps or what goes into building them. After the conversation they are surprised by the amount of work (and money) it costs to build a website. I often don't hear back from them. No negotiation. No questions.</p>
              <p>I wonder sometimes if it would be helpful for them to understand what a website is. That way they could see the actual value of the website and it would be easier to attach a proper monetary value on the building of it.</p>
              <p>So what is a website? These are the first 3 things I can think of:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>It is a platform in virtual space.</b> Just like we build offices in the real world to handle business, provide work environments for employees, and to communicate with clients, a website does that in a virtual space. It says, "We exist. This is where you can find us."</li>
                <li><b>It is your chief virtual marketer.</b> Almost all businesses need some form of marketing/sales. A website is a virtual marketer or salesperson that works 24/7, dresses how you want, and only says what you want it to say. Its reach is global. It can speak multiple languages. It never sleeps and never gets weary. It doesn't need a lunch break. This is a valuable employee.</li>
                <li><b>It is a portal for continuous two-way communication.</b> Direct mail, advertising, email marketing--these are all one-way communication to prospective clients/customers. A website can provide two-way communication via email forms or live chat. It is a platform to schedule consultations and meetings. What it also does is give prospects a way to proactively reach out to you (giving permission), thereby empowering the client/customer. This is a great feeling in our modern age and lets prospects see you in a new light.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Based just on those three things, what would a client pay to have that available to him/her? What is the value of all those things? What is the value of a new office space? What is the value of a marketer or salesperson who never sleeps? What is the value of a two-way portal to clients? $100? $1000? $100,000? These are the questions that clients need to be confronted with.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering if I need to have the value talk first thing in the conversation just to lay the groundwork for the value that is being provided to the client. Then we can get into the nitty gritty of what will be on the site itself. Maybe that would change the whole conversation about monetary value.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">A Cog in the White Collar Assembly Line</h3>
            <h4 class="stories-group-date">May 8, 2019</h4>
            <section class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/mcdonalds-assembly-line.jpg" alt="McDonalds workers putting food together on an assembly line"/></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Today, I read an interesting article called, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-mcdonaldization-of-ux-705438fea958" target="_blank"><i>The McDonaldization of UX</i></a>. The author writes about the standardization of UX design team practices across major corporations and how that has turned him into a "wireframing monkey." There is no longer any creativity or risk. He is merely a cog in a white collar assembly line.</p>
              <p>I'm a front end developer in a corporate marketing department and often feel the same way as the author of the article above. I receive designs that largely look like the last ones (for the sake of consistency) that need to go out in 1-4 week windows. In many ways, I feel like an assembly line piece, too. This has been a source of consternation for me over the past few years. It's a job I've wanted for much of my adult life. The benefits are good. The pay is okay. The company cares about the employees. There is also some security being in a 500-year-old industry.</p>
              <p>How did it get this way, though? For many of the same reasons the article states: <i>Time pressures</i> (time to market, marketing deadlines, launch dates), <i>efficiency</i> (forced by downward pressures in the market), <i>lack of understanding of the process of design and development</i> (seeing us as service providers only and not as people who can bring any strategy to whole process), and <i>product diversification</i> (instead of continuously working on one solid product, creating many sub-branded offshoots of one bestseller). In a world where digital matters and there is so much downward pressure, corners must be cut to keep up. So we create more efficiency, use more frameworks, create more design systems, etc. to keep up. Be creative once and then repeat it&mdash;a lot.</p>
              <p>However, one of the joys of web development is continually learning new things and producing a level of craft that matters. Sadly, corporate web development is based on as close to zero risk as you can get. Corporations make money by pumping out the same things over and over again. So I've become a code monkey of sorts.</p>
              <p>How does one get out of this rut? Seems to me there are three good options:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Quit and join a startup or small agency.</b> If you do this just remember that most startups are trying to get to the level of the company you just left. All that freedom and creativity will go away as growth happens. It's not often that web developers are asked to continuously push forward in mature companies.</li>
                <li><b>Take on side work.</b> Ah, the old side hustle. Start advertising yourself as a freelancer. The beautiful part is that you only have to take on work that you would like to do with clients you would like to work with. Keep your day job and let that be your initial investor. One key here is to position yourself well so that the types of clients you want to work with come knocking. If you're working corporate and you get 3-5 of these side jobs a year it might give you just the kind of risk and outlet you need for your creativity.</li>
                <li><b>Build your own ideas.</b> A third option is to build out your own ideas. Do something with that great idea that you wish someone would make. Your job doesn't want to take your suggestion on a new project? Build out a prototype to get their attention. That's the route that I've taken with my work. I inject time to prototype new ideas and initiatives. I show them to those who are higher than me. I share them with the designers in the company. I've even created an online team to share innovation ideas across the company. Most of these will probably not turn into anything, but it at least gives me an outlet to ideate, prototype, and share with a likeminded community within the company.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I have to believe there is a way to have my cake and eat it, too. My day job is "code monkey." What I want to do and how I want to affect the world is so much bigger, though. So I've tried to create some spaces where I can utilize all of the new things I'm learning, even if my job has no use for them. If you've outgrown your job it might not be that you need to leave the regular paycheck. It might be that you just need to build some places for your new, expansive self to go within the confines of your present life.</p>

            <h3 class="stories-group-headline">Art Direction on the Web</h3>
            <h4 class="stories-group-date">May 7, 2019</h4>
            <section class="stories-image"><a title="Piet Mondrian [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Piet_Mondriaan_-_03.jpg"><img width="1024" alt="Piet Mondriaan - 03" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Piet_Mondriaan_-_03.jpg/1024px-Piet_Mondriaan_-_03.jpg"/></a></section>
            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I've been exploring the idea of art directed websites and web apps. This just means that you're doing something more than just stacking elements on top of each other. You're using the classic principles of design in a way that other media have been using them for the past 100 or so years. Magazines, books, movies&mdash;all of these are being art directed by someone.</p>
              <p>Art direction is someone having a vision for communicating ideas in a certain way. There is a way to art direct a movie, photo shoot, book, or magazine. They aren't exactly the same, but the same principles are involved. In the end, it's about communicating an idea or feeling or thought to the viewer/reader through the design itself, not just the content.</p>
              <p>For most of its existence, the Web has been focused on the technical aspects of communicating information to users. <i>Can we get it to do what we want?</i> That's been a big question. I think this is where we got design systems and frameworks. They can quickly scale up a site or app that works and doesn't look horrid.</p>
              <p>That's been fine and good for a long time. However, new advances in the tools of the presentation layer, such as CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox, are opening up new possibilities. When we figure out that there is more room to stretch out and play&mdash;and the users are also expecting there to be more polished visual communication&mdash;then we should start to see that show up on the sites that we're building.</p>
              <p>As a front end developer I've had the privilege to watch this change happen over the past 20 years. The things that I've dreamed about since I was young are actually possible now. Visions and what-ifs that I had many years ago are what I'm designing and creating today. It's awesome.</p>
              <p>But now is the work. Now is the time to take those dreams and begin to build them. Now is the time to look at the amazing designs on <a href="https://behance.net" target="_blank">Behance</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> and begin to build them on the Web. Now is the time to learn CSS Grid and begin to play with it to see what it will do.</p>
              <p>I hope that we can gradually move out of this rut of stacking blocks on top of one another and instead <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/4057" target="_blank">think more like Mondrian</a>. He painted blocks, but the blocks became interesting and beautiful and speak to something far beyond just a bunch of blocks on top of one another.</p>

              <p>It's always hard to think about the time it takes to start and maintain a blog. There are schedulers, automated systems, and a whole ecosystem of apps that are supposed to help you do it. I guess it really is about putting fingers to keyboard every day and saying <i>something</i>.</p>
              <p>My hope is that the little scraps of code I put on this blog help people solve very real problems as front end developers. If you're learning, buckle up.
