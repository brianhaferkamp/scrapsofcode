            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Today I want to share an update on a new web development education channel. The channel will be a video channel for learning web development with video lessons curated from YouTube. I know that a lot of people learn really well from bloggers writing out their processes. That's never been the way I learn best. When I want to learn some new things, I usually hop over to YouTube and try to find a video. This is especially useful for learning large, general concepts that I can apply in other places.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwvLFLe1xjQO9v7uPxKAnQ" target="_blank">I have been using YouTube to teach web development</a> since about 2014. I find it to be a really great medium to learn and to connect with others. Almost 5,000 subscribers later, I think others are finding it useful, too.</p>
              <p>This idea for a dedicated web development channel is coming from the public television idea. Create a space where you can showcase the best teachers who are already creating individual "shows" and put them all in the same place. The quality of the teaching is key, as is the curation of the best content. I'm not trying to reproduce a typical search for a topic on YouTube. Instead, I want to curate the best teachers and resources. Here's a look at the development progress I've made so far:</p>
              <div class="stories-image"><img src="assets/img/learnWebDevTV_development-progress.png"/></div>
              <p>I've got the mobile view completed for the home page and for the main HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages. Each of those will be further subdivided and will link off to a grid of videos for each of those subdivisions.</p>
              <p>The goal of the project is to make it easier for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CodeNewbies" target="_blank">#CodeNewbies</a> to discern the best teachers on YouTube. This should lessen frustration and lead to more efficient learning.</p>
              <p>A secondary goal is to give creators and teachers a platform to begin creating content for. There are so many talented developers out there who would do really well at connecting with students. They're not easy to find. It takes a while for people to rise to the top and get enough subscribers to start making money on YouTube. That bar is always being moved, as well. I'd like to try and build a community around a channel in order to expedite the process of introducing new teachers and teaching styles into the education process for developers.</p>
              <p>If Phase 1 is successful and the idea takes hold then I'm really excited about what could be possible in the future. I'll keep you posted on the progress and let you know a launch date. I've had one dev reach out to help and would welcome others. Phase 1 will be pretty basic but I could use all the help I can get to make it successful enough to move on to bigger and better ideas.</p>
