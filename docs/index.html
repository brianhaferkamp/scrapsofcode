            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>Today, I read an interesting article called, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-mcdonaldization-of-ux-705438fea958" target="_blank"><i>The McDonaldization of UX</i></a>. The author writes about the standardization of UX design team practices across major corporations and how that has turned him into a "wireframing monkey." There is no longer any creativity or risk. He is merely a cog in a white collar assembly line.</p>
              <p>I'm a front end developer in a corporate marketing department and often feel the same way as the author of the article above. I receive designs that largely look like the last ones (for the sake of consistency) that need to go out in 1-4 week windows. In many ways, I feel like an assembly line piece, too. This has been a source of consternation for me over the past few years. It's a job I've wanted for much of my adult life. The benefits are good. The pay is okay. The company cares about the employees. There is also some security being in a 500-year-old industry.</p>
              <p>How did it get this way, though? For many of the same reasons the article states: <i>Time pressures</i> (time to market, marketing deadlines, launch dates), <i>efficiency</i> (forced by downward pressures in the market), <i>lack of understanding of the process of design and development</i> (seeing us as service providers only and not as people who can bring any strategy to whole process), and <i>product diversification</i> (instead of continuously working on one solid product, creating many sub-branded offshoots of one bestseller). In a world where digital matters and there is so much downward pressure, corners must be cut to keep up. So we create more efficiency, use more frameworks, create more design systems, etc. to keep up. Be creative once and then repeat it&mdash;a lot.</p>
              <p>However, one of the joys of web development is continually learning new things and producing a level of craft that matters. Sadly, corporate web development is based on as close to zero risk as you can get. Corporations make money by pumping out the same things over and over again. So I've become a code monkey of sorts.</p>
              <p>How does one get out of this rut? Seems to me there are three good options:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Quit and join a startup or small agency.</b> If you do this just remember that most startups are trying to get to the level of the company you just left. All that freedom and creativity will go away as growth happens. It's not often that web developers are asked to continuously push forward in mature companies.</li>
                <li><b>Take on side work.</b> Ah, the old side hustle. Start advertising yourself as a freelancer. The beautiful part is that you only have to take on work that you would like to do with clients you would like to work with. Keep your day job and let that be your initial investor. One key here is to position yourself well so that the types of clients you want to work with come knocking. If you're working corporate and you get 3-5 of these side jobs a year it might give you just the kind of risk and outlet you need for your creativity.</li>
                <li><b>Build your own ideas.</b> A third option is to build out your own ideas. Do something with that great idea that you wish someone would make. Your job doesn't want to take your suggestion on a new project? Build out a prototype to get their attention. That's the route that I've taken with my work. I inject time to prototype new ideas and initiatives. I show them to those who are higher than me. I share them with the designers in the company. I've even created an online team to share innovation ideas across the company. Most of these will probably not turn into anything, but it at least gives me an outlet to ideate, prototype, and share with a likeminded community within the company.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I have to believe there is a way to have my cake and eat it, too. My day job is "code monkey." What I want to do and how I want to affect the world is so much bigger, though. So I've tried to create some spaces where I can utilize all of the new things I'm learning, even if my job has no use for them. If you've outgrown your job it might not be that you need to leave the regular paycheck. It might be that you just need to build some places for your new, expansive self to go within the confines of your present life.</p>
