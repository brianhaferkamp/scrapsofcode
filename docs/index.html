              <p>In web development there is a leading edge and there are laggards. The cutting edge is often established by large companies trying to push the base languages farther--whether for a challenge, to solve an internal problem, or as a way of creating competitive advantage. Meanwhile, the base languages are concerned with legacy and what is going to be the most useful in the long run.</p>
              <p>One example of this is the plethora of frameworks that exist. It seems we're creating new ones just because we can. However, they usually spring up as solutions to a particular company's problem. So it fits that company and--if it's generally applicable--can solve problems for many others. The more general the more widely adopted it will be.</p>
              <p>However, once the base languages realize what developers want and where the browsers are going, they often take measures to release new features for the core languages that undermine the frameworks and make it easier to implement the same thing with less overhead. This has happened with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the past 10 years.</p>
              <p>Once the core languages implement solutions that were previously hacks and additions, there is literally no longer a need for the hacks and extra work it entails.</p>
              <p>I suppose this will continue to happen. You can get out front with the cool kids--knowing that what you're learning might be irrelevant in 10 years but it's awesome today--or you can hang back and continue on with the core languages--knowing that what you're using is stable and accepted by most major browsers.</p>
              <p>My contention is that you need to think carefully about what you're doing when you take on new frameworks or technologies. Try to discern what is really important, what is the best use of your time to learn, and what will give you a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</p>
              <p>The base languages will always be there. The new startup hotness framework probably won't. Something to think about as you look out at the development landscape and consider what you should pick up or start learning.</p>
