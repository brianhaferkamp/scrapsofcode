              <p>I consider myself a remote worker. I have three days in an office and two days working remotely.</p>
              <p>Yesterday I video conferenced with a team in India, chatted with my supervisor, completed my work, and spent the day with my wife and kids. I was productive, got paid, and was able to spend time with people I love the most (no offense to my coworkers).</p>
              <p>Over the last two years working remotely has enabled me to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Spend a month in Europe with my family</li>
                <li>Have more time with my family</li>
                <li>Save money on my commute</li>
                <li>Work while traveling in East Asia</li>
                <li>Be a meaningful part of an organization outside my work</li>
                <li>Have flexibility on <i>when</i> I work as well as where</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These are all very life-giving and I'm grateful for the flexibility my job allows. It makes me sad when I hear about situations where people are chained to a desk and a cubicle for no apparent reasons. They are not high level or in meetings constantly.</p>
              <p>I believe that an office is largely about control, not productivity. So many corporations operate in silos that it's a farce to say that it's about productivity. I dare say that many young people are actually using technology to break down the silos whether or not they are present on site. To me, that speaks to the ability of modern communication technologies to bring people together from disparate parts of the company, not drive a wedge between them.</p>
              <p>I've worked as a freelancer and in an agency that was mostly a distributed team (we met together once a week in an office downtown). Both of those experiences were very good for me and I enjoy the freedom that comes from remote work. I think that's really it: freedom. It's not that I'm bucking against the control of the office, it's just that I mostly don't see the point in being forced to be together with people you can't get to know (because of the silos, departments, cubicles, walls, etc.) doing work that could be done in another place.</p>
              <p>Most of the objections to remote work revolve around not knowing if employees are really working or not. This fear is just a control mechanism to keep it all moving the way it's always been. There are so many ways to know if an employee is working or not. Foremost is the work itself. Is it getting done? Then the person is working. With phones, texting, email, video chat, IM, and more there really is no excuse not to give people the freedom to be in the place they want to be to do their work.</p>
              <p>Remote work means there must be new processes for accountability that need to be put into place. Managers need to learn to deal with both the work and the employee. There is an amount of emotional intelligence that must be in place because one of the parties (the employee) can no longer be controlled the same. Our metrics for a successful employee need to change from time-based to quality-based. An employee might be only working 4-6 hours a day but still producing as much as someone working an 8-hour day. When you can't "see" productivity (which just means the person is at the desk working when a manager walks by) you have to gauge it a different way. The quality of the work and whether or not the employee is hitting the "normal" production levels are the metrics for success for remote workers.</p>
              <p>Now that I've said polarizing things, I'll bring it back to the middle. Remote work is appropriate for employees doing conceptual work or digital work (designers, programmers, developers, marketers, et al.). There are still many positions that require physical presence. Sometimes conceptual positions can also benefit from physical presence, too.</p>
              <p>How do you feel about remote work? Like it? Is it the future of all things? I'm interested to hear what you think.</p>
