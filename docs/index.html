              <p>Getting motivated to write code can sometimes be a chore. For me, the hard parts are at the beginning of projects I don't want to do or the middle of projects I've already started. When I have something I'm excited to start working on it's easy to take off and start coding. Getting a project through the middle stages, however, is more difficult for me. I'm a stage one rocket developer, I guess.</p>
              <p>One thing that has really helped over the years is developing a work groove. I just made that up. There must be a technical name for that. What I mean is that I sit in the same chair, have a routine, and even have "work" music. If I want to get stuff done I have playlists that help me focus in on writing code. The playlists go in cycles for me, but usually it's metal and hard rock. Here are my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1F_FqSgqwHngzPiVn2DB4EE" target="_blank">Rock Favorites</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1Fnr2wQHzxCc4VsMvOlbvhF" target="_blank">Blindside</a>, one of my favorite Swedish metal bands of all time. Sometimes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1F72ivGtPcPc8UfyfJn3qtU" target="_blank">Twenty One Pilots</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMklnyuK-t1Fx_QpQ5gDKAMszzP8GBqVM" target="_blank">Switchfoot</a> does the trick, too. It's as though my brain knows when certain music comes on that it's time to write code.</p>
              <p>Here are some things you can do to find your own groove.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Set a consistent place to work.</b> It might take working in a couple of spots to find your ideal work environment. Once you find it, do it every time. I sit in the same chair on the same side of the table each day. My desk stays arranged the same way at the office, too.</li>
                <li><b>Set a consistent time to work.</b> It's important to have your body know it's work time. Train it by working a consistent schedule. This is easier for company work and harder if you're a freelancer or work from home. On my work from home days I try to keep the same schedule as my office days. If you're a remote worker identify your rhythms. Are you most alert in the morning, middle of the day, or at night. If you can adjust your coding time to these periods of the day your time in the code might be more productive and enjoyable.</li>
                <li><b>Create a pre-work ritual or routine.</b> What rituals do you do to signal your brain that it's about to enter work mode? For me, I get up at 5am and take time to think, read, and meditate. Then shower and either get ready to drive to the office or sit down to code. Last thing I do before I turn on the computer is get a cup of coffee. This routine let's my body know it's time to transition to thinking about writing code.</li>
                <li><b>Find out what blocks out distractions for you.</b> For me, it's the right music. Static/white noise, traffic, looking at a particular coffee shop mural, silence. Whatever you need around you to get yourself focused, find it and do it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In the beginning it will take some time to figure these things out for yourself. Try something. If it doesn't work try something else. Make note of when you're most productive.</p>
              <p>Web development is a job full of repetition and routine. Becoming a creature of habit will help your brain and body get into the groove.</p>
