              <p>We are at the cusp of another step in the evolution (de-evolution?) of the Internet and the World Wide Web. What was once a global sharing system primarily used for communication is growing up into an all-encompassing virtual world. At the beginning, we used terms like <i>site</i> or <i>home</i> to represent the things we built in this virtual land grab. Now those metaphors are becoming a reality. This virtual world will (most likely) be a home for many. There are many implications of this for being human, but that is a digression.</p>
              <p>I'm certainly not obsessed with the future. I think I will see major systemic change in the next two decades (provided I make it that long) as the world begins to embrace virtual and augmented reality. These are the next evolution of the Internet and the Web. Up to this point, we have been outside the Matrix looking in but eventually we will be inside it&mdash;part of it. Are you ready Player One?</p>
              <p>I work in a retail industry&mdash;books to be specific. A lot has changed before I got into it and the advent of digital books themselves has upended the entire industry. I believe the coming wave of AR and VR will send it all into a tailspin. Publishing houses have gone from printers to media firms and will have to make a new shift into experience houses. They are the places where the best stories can be told. They are the ones who have made fictions real in the heads of trillions over the last 200 years. With that ability to tell and share stories they have first crack at building the stories that so many will live in over the next 50-100 years. The Century of the Story is upon us and they are the holders of the stories so many people love. It will be interesting.</p>
              <p>But publishers also sell books&mdash;at least they sell stories and content that were formerly only published as books. I think that book publishing will continue into the near future but there will be a whole other world in which story content is consumed in a hundred other ways.</p>
              <p>One of the "here and now" things that I think about is the future of retail. What will it look like when augmented reality becomes common? With access to the physical and virtual realities at the same time, how will shopping change? I think it presents some really exciting things for the future. I can shop in a physical store but have access to a company's entire stock through the digital. I know that this exists now in the form of our phones but in the future the transition from physical to digital will be more seamless&mdash;possibly more human, if you can imagine.</p>
              <p>Yesterday I set out to simulate a shopping experience that might happen in the near future. This is my own version of what book shopping might look like for my company in the not so distant future. The experience is based on voice commands and some sort of wearable heads up display. This is just a prototype and a simulation. I'm sure commercial versions of this will be slicker, but it's a start. I think we need a vision for what the experience could be. Here is a video taking you through the prototype:</p>

              <p>I created the prototype that I used in the video in Adobe XD. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/dd2a36fc-1536-47ca-5162-f038aef5cfea-ab1b/" target="_blank">Try out the prototype here</a>.</p>
              <p>I'm curious to know what others think of the future. Leave a comment on Twitter by clicking the card below and replying to the tweet.</p>
