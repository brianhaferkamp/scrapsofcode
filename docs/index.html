            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>This is a bit of a self-aware post. I just want to write a bit about this blog.</p>
              <p>The blog is pretty minimal in terms of the UI but it's also being written and uploaded by hand. Writing code from scratch isn't that new for me. At work, I build 20-30% of my sites writing code from scratch. In a volume production environment, though, there are some shortcuts, setups, and frameworks that need to be used to get things out the door in a timely fashion. No need to reinvent the wheel every single time.</p>
              <p>On this blog, though, I wanted something more hand-crafted. So I type each post right into the code editor, insert links by hand, and do all of my own image finding and editing. It feels very 2000s to me. Pre-blogs. Pre-CMS. I like it.</p>
              <P>I find that it gets me into the content. I feel that I own the content and have a lot of freedom to put anything I want into each post. There is a certain pain to writing content in HTML and having to style any new thing I want to put into a post. It makes me think about whether I need it or not. I also find that the manual process of moving files over to Github makes me take an extra pass to make sure everything is the way I want it. I don't like the change/upload/refresh cycle for minor things, especially when I could have saved time and energy by just double checking and proofing the content beforehand.</P>
              <p>I'm also trying to get the conversation going on Twitter by using Twitter embeds for the likes, shares, and comments. Not sure if that's a stupid idea or not. But I figure it could help to spread the blog to others via Twitter. It's possible that a simple share feature is better. We'll have to see.</p>
