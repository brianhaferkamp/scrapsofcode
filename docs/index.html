              <p>Today I want to share some of my criteria for critiquing website designs. This does not have to do with code or interactions but the visual design itself. As most projects begin with some sort of visual design or elements, it's a good checklist to have.</p>
              <h4>Using words instead of visuals</h4>
              <p>Are you using words to say something that could be said with a visual? If so, then consider dropping the words and replacing the text with something visual, like a video, photo, infographic, or icon. According to this <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3035856/why-were-more-likely-to-remember-content-with-images-and-video-infogr" target="_blank">Fast Company article on visual content and memory</a>, "visuals are processed 60,000 times faster than text."</p>
              <h4>Readability</h4>
              <p>Can the text be read easily? I'm looking at things like line length (how many words per line) and legibility (can you read the text over background colors or images) This is a little different than contrast. You want to make sure the text and buttons pop off of backgrounds. If the background is busy, consider a blur or darker color overlay.</p>
              <h4>Fonts</h4>
              <p>The right font can make or break a design. There is a reason that we have so many fonts to choose from. The main thing I want to know about the font is whether or not it's the right choice for the site/app. You know this by figuring out the target market for the product. For instance, Black letter or a Gothic script font is probably not the right choice for a mommy blog. The more mainstream your product or service, the more you will need to choose a rather bland font. Something strong and sans-serif works well when your audience is diverse.</p>
              <p>The other thing I look at are font combinations. Do they work together? Are they both speaking the same thing to the same audience? If you're not confident in font pairings, consider looking to a site like <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/" target="_blank">typewolf.com, where you can learn all about fonts, pairings, and recommendations</a>. Don't have the eye for font pairings, stick with one font family and work with different sizes and weights from that one family. It brings a sense of cohesion to the design when you do that. Check out this <a href="https://design.google/library/choosing-web-fonts-beginners-guide/" target="_blank">a step-by-step guide for choosing fonts for the web</a> from Google.</p>
              <p>You might also consider a super family that might have both serif and sans-serif fonts. Here are some examples of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/featured/Superfamilies" target="_blank">super families on Google Fonts</a> that you can easily incorporate into a website.</p>
              <h4>Colors</h4>
              <p>The last major category is color. Things I'm looking at are appropriateness to the product and target audience and contrast/legibility.</p>
              <p>There is actually a lot in the concept of appropriateness. If your product is only going to be consumed by the people of one country you need to know what those people grow up thinking about certain colors. Red in one country might not mean the same thing in other countries. One good example is seeing a person's name in red ink in Korea means that the person is deceased or (if living) that you wish them dead. That's probably not what you're going for in your design so if the audience is global, make sure you're not offending with the color choices you're making.</p>
              <p>Another major consideration is contrast. Do the colors you choose (especially for text) have enough contrast for the Web? In print, there are some things you can get away with, but when you build things online you have no control of the output for each user. Therefore, you need to follow some standard design rules. To check whether or not your colors have enough contrast you can use <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">a tool like the color contrast checker from WebAIM</a>. It allows you to input your foreground and background colors and check the contrast levels. Passing the AA level (4.5:1) is a good start. If you can pass on the AAA level (7:1) then you're doing great. You might find that this cramps your design aesthetic, but you're probably just going to have to change the way you think between the Web and print. It's not the same thing.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, this gives you a nice framework for critiquing website designs. The Web is not print. We have no control of the outputs where our work will be shown. So use the tools referenced above and you'll start to understand why websites look the way they do and begin to work within those boundaries to create amazing designs of your own.</p>
