              <p>One of the struggles of any profession is providing appropriate solutions to problems. The old adage is, "To a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Web developers are no different. For the JavaScript specialist, everything can be fixed with JS. For the PHP developer, everything can be solved with databases and PHP. But what if the needs of the client are not conducive to your primary skill set? This is where the challenge comes in. Do you continue forward knowing that what you're going to build is a lot more complicated than the client needs? Or will you convey to the client they need something else then refer them to someone who can more appropriately handle his/her needs? Maybe you choose a third way and build what is appropriate but with secondary or tertiary skills. That's an option, too.</p>
              <p>One way to help clients is to listen to them and ask them questions that help determine an appropriate path. Do they just need something small and lightweight that won't be changing anytime soon? Perhaps a standard HTML landing page is the best way to go. Do they need a little more but not quite a full-blown system that needs to be managed? Look into a larger HTML site but using something like <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> to manage it. Does the client think he/she needs a small site when he/she really needs a fully managed CMS? Then explain how a management system can make the client's life easier. You are the consultant. You are fluent in Web things. Your expertise matters here at the front end of the project.</p>
              <p>The problem with doing everything one way for all clients is that you put the client in a bad position. In doing this the developer is not looking out for the client. Instead, he/she is pushing his/her own system onto the client and ignoring the consequences that the client will have to live with. This started happening several years ago when devs began building so many sites with WordPress. The reality is that most clients don't need that level of sophistication. They just need a brochure site. WordPress is a system, though. A great system for creating dynamic content, but not a great system for creating sites that should just be static HTML. So it was an inappropriate build for many clients, but it was done because there were devs who could build the sites that way and clients who were being educated poorly about what they needed.</p>
              <p>So here's a solution. Listen to the client. Determine the most appropriate development solution/stack/platform and then either deliver that out of your own knowledge or begin to create a network of other devs/agencies that you can pass clients along to who specialize in the work the client needs. Consider setting up a small finders fee, if the person/agency is willing. It would be better to make a client happy because you listened to him/her and provided an appropriate solution. Burdening the client with the responsibilities of a printing press when all he/she needed was a printer is irresponsible and short-sighted. Let's do better.</p>
