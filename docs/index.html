              <p>I've been developing websites and learning the languages for about 20 years. However, it's just over the past 3 years that I've worked steadily in a corporate environment. When I started I thought it would be similar to being a freelancer except there would be more teammates, free coffee, and resources to create amazing things. So far it hasn't turned out that way. And maybe it never will.</p>
              <p>Shortly after I arrived my team got blown up and now I'm the only front end developer left. That makes for great variety and I get to learn new things all the time, but it also means I'm pretty lonely. I assume others find themselves as the lone developers in their companies, too. There are others here but they are all in the back end services department now. There's also no free coffee.</p>
              <p>While it's true that there are more resources to do amazing things we can only do amazing things as they relate to the priorities of several people above our team. We essentially do what they say when they want it done. You know...work. Somehow I thought it might be different than regular work because the Web is new and dynamic and full of so many possibilities. But in the end it can only be as dynamic as those who are directing the companies activities.</p>
              <p>All that said, the perks of a corporate positino are good: Steady paycheck, benefits, co-workers, ability to travel and work remotely, and my company allows me to care for my family.</p>
              <p>So I'm learning some balance between work self and outside project self. I thought it would all sort of come together as one and others would be open to pushing forward with ideas and designs and leaning on any expertise I might have in this area. Really, though, that is only for outside projects or any client work I take on. It's a learning curve and transition from doing it all on my own as a freelancer. Something to think about if you're transitioning from freelance work to an agency or corporate environment.</p>
