            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>I sometimes have freelance clients who want me to build a website for them. Often, they are small businesses or solopreneurs. Many of them have no idea about websites or apps or what goes into building them. After the conversation they are surprised by the amount of work (and money) it costs to build a website. I often don't hear back from them. No negotiation. No questions.</p>
              <p>I wonder sometimes if it would be helpful for them to understand what a website is. That way they could see the actual value of the website and it would be easier to attach a proper monetary value on the building of it.</p>
              <p>So what is a website? These are the first 3 things I can think of:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>It is a platform in virtual space.</b> Just like we build offices in the real world to handle business, provide work environments for employees, and to communicate with clients, a website does that in a virtual space. It says, "We exist. This is where you can find us."</li>
                <li><b>It is your chief virtual marketer.</b> Almost all businesses need some form of marketing/sales. A website is a virtual marketer or salesperson that works 24/7, dresses how you want, and only says what you want it to say. Its reach is global. It can speak multiple languages. It never sleeps and never gets weary. It doesn't need a lunch break. This is a valuable employee.</li>
                <li><b>It is a portal for continuous two-way communication.</b> Direct mail, advertising, email marketing--these are all one-way communication to prospective clients/customers. A website can provide two-way communication via email forms or live chat. It is a platform to schedule consultations and meetings. What it also does is give prospects a way to proactively reach out to you (giving permission), thereby empowering the client/customer. This is a great feeling in our modern age and lets prospects see you in a new light.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Based just on those three things, what would a client pay to have that available to him/her? What is the value of all those things? What is the value of a new office space? What is the value of a marketer or salesperson who never sleeps? What is the value of a two-way portal to clients? $100? $1000? $100,000? These are the questions that clients need to be confronted with.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering if I need to have the value talk first thing in the conversation just to lay the groundwork for the value that is being provided to the client. Then we can get into the nitty gritty of what will be on the site itself. Maybe that would change the whole conversation about monetary value.</p>
