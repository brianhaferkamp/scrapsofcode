              <p>I learned how to build websites when no one was asking whether designers need to learn how to code or developers need to learn how to design. Back then you were called "Webmaster" (still a great title if you can get it) and you were probably the only person you knew that could develop a website or even knew what web design really was. That meant you also needed to do the design work for the website, too. Heck, you even needed to be an information architect (i.e., UX Designer).</p>
              <p>Occasionally I get a chance to do some design work at my day job (I do a lot more for clients or side projects). I was working on a redesign of a project I built a few years ago and found myself asking, "What is the best way to lay out this page so that it reaches the goals for this product?"</p>
              <p>This is a big question for us today as designers because we have so much available to us as far as tools to communicate with. We can use text, video, audio, animation, and lots of interactive elements. It used to be that only the big players in the marketing world could use these elements, but now they're available to anyone. But with that power to communicate in so many different ways comes the necessity to do a lot more planning regarding what to use and when.</p>
              <p>I was looking at that blank page wondering, "In what order should I put the elements from the marketing team?" I found this nice <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/09/02/how-to-design-a-foolproof-website-with-storytelling/" target="_blank">article from The Next Web on how to use your website to tell the story of a brand or product</a>. One thing that caught my eye was the section about Act 1, Act 2, and Act 3 (about 2/3 of the way down the page). This really helped me to think about the sections on the site and pacing of the elements.</p>
              <p>How can I mix and match elements on the page to give the most appropriate impact? When I need to build emotion in the story, am I using an emotional or evocative element like an image or video? When I need to be filling in the backstory, am I using the right kind of text? If someone scans the page, can they get the gist of what the product is and how it can benefit the user?</p>
              <p>There is just a lot to designing a page that is intended to get the user to <i>do</i> something. Some products are easier to do that with while others are a little more difficult.</p>
              <p>I finally decided to think about the 1 or 2 actions I want a user to take and then asked myself: "What information does the user need in order to take those actions?" I think in the end that is going to yield the best result. That gives me a base outline for how to tell the story and what elements to place along the way.</p>
