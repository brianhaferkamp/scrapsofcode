              <p>Learning how to systematize your workflow is one of the keys to being successful in web design and development. This is why large companies create design systems or frameworks. Systems can help create consistency and increase speed. They also allow the developer more time to focus on one-off elements by speeding up the development of common problems. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time.</p>
              <p>One of the things that I've done is to create a build system that includes all of my favorite tools. This system speeds up my workflow and helps me to create component elements that I can use across my clients' websites. I use this build system both for client work and for HTML sites at my day job. It has knocked off a lot of setup and development time because I was just setting up and building the same things for every site I was developing.</p>
              <p>When thinking about creating a system, here are some questions to answer:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>What tools can you use to help you develop sites faster?</li>
                <li>What can you do to systematize your file structures?</li>
                <li>What outside libraries and frameworks do you use all the time?</li>
                <li>What common, pre-written code components can you create to save you time?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>One of the greatest benefits of systematizing is that you save time--and time is money. Something we don't think about as much, though, is that we also save our eyes, our fingers, and our humanity. There is more time for doing things away from the computer. This is time that can be spent on building your business or creating better strategies for your clients so that you can execute the code in a way that's more helpful to them. You could also spend that extra time being outside, exercising, or building relationships. These are all healthy components of a web developer's life.</p>
              <p>If you're new to all this or looking for a way to get up and running quickly, you can <a href="https://github.com/brianhaferkamp/20-mile-head-start" target="_blank">download and use my HTML/CSS/JS build system</a>. It's a Node-based system that includes Pug JS, SASS, Autprefixer (for CSS), BrowserSync, and Gulp for processing tasks. The instructions are in the readme of the repository. If you run into any errors, just follow the prompts on the CLI window. I try to keep it as updated as possible. If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd love to hear them. FYI, I've recently added a service worker to the build so that it can be used to turn your website into a progressive web app. You can read about it at the bottom of the readme file.</p>
              <p>There are any number of ways to create a system that works for you and can help you in your normal workflow. Look first at your workflow and try to figure out where you can create systems to get you through the parts that are common to each project or client. Systematization creates consistency and allows you to begin feeling like an expert who can provide value to your clients. This increased confidence in meeting the needs of your clients will help to convince clients that you are the least risky option when they are looking for a vendor to handle their web development. When you are dealing with clients directly, you should strive to become the <em>most valuable, least risky</em> option. That will help you close more deals and get more work.</p>
