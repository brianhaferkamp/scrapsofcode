              <p>I'm over 40 and have been learning web design and development for about 20 years. The Web itself is only 30 years old. I won't say that I've been anything special in the field, just an early adopter. But that early adoption means that I've gained a lot of experience handling the core languages and seen a lot of the different trends along the way.</p>
              <p>But I'm old. At least in the eyes of many out there. Especially hiring managers.</p>
              <p>As we go along we'll find that more and more developers and designers are going to be "old" in the coming decade. That leads to a lot of questions from startups and among the community of developers who still want to do amazing, cutting edge work. Here are the things that seem to be the most troublesome:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Older developers' bodies are slowing down.</strong> The reality is that as you get older so does your body. That includes your brain. I was speaking with another programmer about this. He's learning a lot of new languages at the same time. He believes that his younger self would have picked it up more quickly than his middle-aged self. As you get older you just need more time to process things. The upside is that you have become a more efficient learner. When you're young you use your energy to push through your mistakes (and you make a lot of mistakes because of your inexperience). However, the older you are the fewer mistakes you make because you know which paths to go down and which to avoid. This creates an efficiency that allows you to still compete.</li>
                <li><strong>Older developers have families and responsibilities.</strong> Most people are waiting until their late 20's (sometimes longer) to start a family. This means that a lot of the competition for jobs in this industry are going to young people with no attachments and few responsibilities. There is also a tendency to move from their homes to places like Silicon Valley or Austin to seek out good jobs in tech. It's not really a surprise that companies are places where "fitting in" is a really big deal. This is where a lot of your relationships will be formed. For older developers who already have families, the bean bag and ping pong workplace just isn't that important because we have people and responsibilities at home. This is just what happens as you get older. There are always corporations who are ready to give those older developers a good, steady job that allows them to support their families and be able to prioritize those responsiblities. The drawback is that the work you do is pretty safe and conservative. Few corporations are pushing the limits with what they're doing. That trade-off can be too much for some developers and they seek the startup/agency life which puts them back into the companies with bean bags and energy drink induced all night hackathons. It's just a weird place to be as an older developer because the market hasn't created a space that is vibrant in the kinds of projects you work on and grown up in employment.</li>
                <li><strong>Older developers have wisdom and experience.</strong> The one thing that continues to grow as you age, even as things slow down, is your wisdom and experience. Older developers and programmers should be thought of like bonds. Keep them around to age and mature and it will pay dividends in the future. When you've worked in a field for 20 years or more you've seen just about all there is. When the field is as old as the people working in it then they've literally seen everything. Why wouldn't a company want that sort of experience on their team? One issue is money. That experience and wisdom is worth something. Maybe worth more than companies are willing to spend. This could certainly be another hurdle for a seasoned developer in working with startups and small agencies. I would hope that companies and agencies begin to see that one older developer could be worth two younger, less skilled developers. Or that bringing in one veteran developer to a group of young developers (assuming the older developer is concerned with teaching and guiding) could actual grow the team faster in terms of their skills and outputs. This doesn't necessarily have to be a senior role but could be. Depends on the developer.</li>

              <p>I'm sure there are a lot more issues. If you know of some leave them as a comment on the Twitter card below.</p>
