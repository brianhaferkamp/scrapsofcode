              <p>I tend to live with the belief that the Web is the future of web development. Call me crazy. But it doesn't always seem that way. There are many companies that would love to create the platform that kills the Web and takes away market/attention share. It's like trying to recreate the solar system inside the already existent one and asking people to come inside. At some point the people will realize that it's just a small, fake recreation that only fills the needs of some. They will want more.</p>
              <p>So the future is the open Web.</p>
              <p>These are seemingly elementary thoughts but important ones. I'm trying to think education over the next 10 years. What will devs need to know? Where should they be developing their skills right now? Who is pushing the ball into the next decade of development and design?</p>
              <p>I hope to get to some of those answers and incorporate them into the dev education platform I'm building. Right now, I think the important thing is that we educate new web developers who are well-versed in the fundamentals of the Web languages (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) so that they will be nimble enough to build on that foundation to create whatever is coming. I'm thinking, especially, of the coming VR/AR, AI, and IoT revolutions. I don't know <i>how</i> we'll build those things but I do know it's coming at us quickly.</p>
              <p>What do you think developers should be focusing on for the next 10 years?</p>
