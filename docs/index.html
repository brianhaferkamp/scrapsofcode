              <p>Days like today are the concern I've had about writing a blog. There are so many things to write about and so few hours to write about them. It amounts to writer's block. So here's a mostly blank page talking about the difficulty of writing words about something I know a lot about. Not exactly noteworthy, so I'm sorry if this is a waste of time or a click. I promised more things will come that are worth that click.</p>
              <p>A really smart thing to do would be to write out a list of topics and subtopics that I could write about. That way I always have something to refer back to for ideas and to create balance with the subjects I write about. This is the organizational side of me. I'm good at that, especially for others.</p>
              <p>So far I've taken a very spontaneous route with this blog. I've got some things in my back pocket as far as video tutorials or code that I've written on Codepen. However, I don't want to use those all the time. I'd like this to be a mix of thoughts and code and videos.</p>
              <p>Even though these particular thoughts feel a little empty, maybe they'll help someone realize that it's okay to say something and nothing. It's okay just to get something down on the page with the hope that better thoughts will come tomorrow. That's an important part of coding, writing, even life. Wake up, do your best, let what comes come, and try it all again tomorrow.</p>
