              <p>I consider myself lucky to have learned web development when I did in the late 1990s. It was a real wild west so you could make things that weren't that sophisticated and you were considered a success. Drop down menus and app-like UIs were pretty crazy. A little CSS could make your site really stand out.</p>
              <p>For people going into web development today, the lines are not so straight. It seems like there are a lot of short cuts to getting to web development. Lots of tools that will help make your life easier&mdash;if you know what you're doing already. That's the tricky part, right? Getting to competency.</p>
              <p>My suggestion to new web developers is to get very proficient at building products on the Web using the baseline languages&mdash;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll probably be surprised at all the things you can build just with that simple setup. The Web is literally built on them. And when you throw in images, video, APIs, etc. there are a lot of products that can be built just with those base languages and concepts. Practice them constantly. When you get to the point that you can't build something in your head then go out and research how to do it with something outside these base languages.</p>
              <p>If you're a new developer, don't skimp on learning the fundamentals. HTML and CSS will take you very far. Basic JavaScript will push you even farther. Always keep in mind that you are building a platform for communicating some message.</p>
              <p>My best example is this humble blog. There is nothing fancy here. I do some pre-processing of the HTML and CSS, but, in the end, the code is simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The important part is always the content. It is on the Web and can potentially affect millions of people. That's a powerful thing. Never lose sight of the fact that the base languages can give you that kind of power.</p>
