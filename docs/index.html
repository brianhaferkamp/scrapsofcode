            <article class="stories-group-content">
              <p>An idea has been ruminating in my head for a couple of years. It centers around online education in web development.</p>
              <p>My background is that I'm a self-taught developer. I learned HTML and CSS at the same time I was working on my undergraduate degree. That was back in 1997. I picked up <i>HTML for Dummies</i> and used my free Geocities account to mark up the files and get them online. It was the wild west, for sure. I loved the idea of publishing work online and here was the platform to do it.</p>
              <p>I say that because I have an affinity for self-taught developers and designers. It says something when a person says, "I want <i>that</i>," and then goes for it.</p>
              <p>The beauty of today is that it is possible to do so without even buying a book. All you need is a basic computer and an internet connection. With tools like Github and YouTube, the classroom has shifted from the trade school or university to the living room or dining room.</p>
              <p>The idea I have is for a video-based channel that brings together the best online video teachers from YouTube to share their knowledge of languages, methodologies, lifestyle, and techniques to the people of the world in an effort to raise up the next generation of web developers&mdash;all for free.</p>
              <p>I'm personally involved in teaching online through my YouTube tutorials. I've been doing that since about 2014 or so. This is usually how I level up my own skills, even for what I'm doing at work. I know there are millions of others who are visual learners like that and would benefit from bringing together teaching on different subjects and languages.</p>
              <p>Phase 1 is to start with the basics&mdash;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll focus on basic understanding and usage, as well as throwing in some new standards, like CSS Grid Layout, Flexbox, and ES6.</p>
              <p>Phase 2 will bring in more personality. We will try to branch out from code and into coding life. So many people are working remotely or in other countries that it is beneficial to hear their voices. We'll also begin to focus in on the business of web development. How do you get jobs? How do you price your work? How do you get work remotely? There are lots of topics there.</p>
              <p>Phase 3 is original programming. That's...well, that's a dream right now.</p>
              <p>Here are a couple of screenshots of the design so far. You can also <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/abee3acb-8a38-4931-4a7d-feb82abec5ae-dddf/" target="_blank">see the mockups online</a>. Feel free to leave a comment.</p>

              <p>I want the UI to be simple for the sake of clarity and loading speed. There are a lot of videos on here. I'll hook into the YouTube API to bring in the videos and featured channels. I'm not sure when this will be live. I'm hoping to get a prototype live by this summer.</p>
