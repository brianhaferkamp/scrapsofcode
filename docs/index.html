              <p>The musical, <i>Hamilton</i>, has beautiful production value. It also strikes a very strong emotional chord with the audience. They manage to move the audience through music, the tone of the lyrics, and through the movement of the props and characters on the stage.</p>
              <p>One of the unsung heroes of the entire production is color. Many of the traditional devices of the theater are not present (like curtains) to obstruct or show scene change. Instead, there is a rotating stage and a beautiful presentation of color through light. The use of reds and blues (and even an ocean scene in the beginning) help to tell the story of the internal emotions of the characters. It really is beautiful to watch, as well as a compelling story.</p>
              <p>Lots of times we get caught up in the utility of designing web pages and apps. We are so consumed as developers and designers about the UX of the product that we sometimes forget that we can build emotional experience into our designs and experiences.</p>
              <p>One of the things I notice a lot is becoming a slave to the brand colors. We tell ourselves, "Keep it simple. Not too many colors so that we can highlight what the user is supposed to do." In a world of small devices, small touch points, and low attention span, that is actually a wise thing to do. Using one or two colors is great to clearly delineate where users should click.</p>
              <p>But what about the coming world of VR and AR? I imagine that attention span will be much less of a problem and we will need to focus on designing for experience a lot more. It will be more about moving the user through the fantastical new lens of a new world. How will we engage all of the senses when they are all plugged in and ready to be engaged? What will we use to tell the stories of products and companies so that we give users something to feel and engage with in this new sensory-overloaded world?</p>
              <p>Creating pages that get users to connect emotionally to products and services may not seem important now because there is so much distance between the user and the digital page/app. In the near future, though, it will be a very important skill to have. Practicing now may not yield the types of emotional connections we desire, but I think in the end those who are putting that into practice will be ahead of the curve once user reality goes virtual.</p>
