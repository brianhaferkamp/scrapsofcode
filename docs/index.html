              <p>I started out in web development (then only known as web design) back in the 1990s. I have no idea what it's like to start out today. Overwhelming, I imagine. When I started all we had, really, was HTML4. CSS was starting to gain traction around that time but we hadn't even moved into the world of web standards. Browsers were all doing their thing.</p>
              <p>When I look around I even get dizzy with all of the shiny bells and whistles out there fighting for attention. Seems like every week there is something new to pay attention to. And social media has made it all the more distracting. I have to include myself in that. I create lots of little things that I'd like people to pay attention to or use. I think they will be useful. But maybe they are just a major distraction to those who are learning.</p>
              <p>That brings me to the main point: Crawl, walk, run. It takes a while to do all of this so give yourself some time to learn properly. If you set the foundation of your web development learning, it will pay dividends in the future. One of the best reasons to start from the very beginning is that you become a more nimble and flexible developer because you understand how everything works together. That helps you solve problems from a different angle. You can bring your own unique spin to things.</p>
              <p>If you're completely new to web development, I highly encourage you to get HTML5 thoroughly. Learn how to mark up your code for the sake of accessibility. Many devs have to go back to learn this important part because they never learned it to start with. If you know how to write easy-to-read, accessible code it will help you and the user.</p>
              <p>Once you know how to write accessible HTML5 then move onto styling the page with CSS. Write so much CSS that you start to understand what your styles are going to look like before you write them. It helps at this stage to also mix in some basic design knowledge. This includes typography, layout, and color. These are so important to presenting the site in a clear and pleasing way. The idea is that users feel so comfortable with the page that they don't see the design. They only get the information clearly and thoroughly.</p>
              <p>The last step of the beginning dev process is to dive into JavaScript. This is the language of movement on the web. It is what the muscles are to the body. You can get work without learning JavaScript but that is actually not easy to find. Most people want you to have some baseline of knowledge when it comes to JS. JavaScript is a relatively easy language to learn the fundamentals of object oriented programming. It doesn't require any special setup to make it work. Everything is right in the browser for you to get started. There are some great JavaScript resources online for you to use. FreeCodeCamp.org and YouTube are two that I've used in the past.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of people beginning the journey of web development. It can be frustrating. That's part of learning something new. Don't take the shortcut. Just learn the baseline languages and begin to develop more sophistication from there. Get used to searching online for answers. You will need the skills of a researcher and the persistence of a beat reporter to do this work. There is a lot of information out there. Learn how to start with what you know and then begin synthesizing information and keywords into a better search.</p>
              <p>In some ways I envy the devs starting out today. However, starting out in the Wild West of web development meant that I had to deconstruct what others had done and consume the few books available. This made me a better developer and gave me the skills that I still use each day I come to work. I hope that your journey goes well. Get stuck. Break things so you can fix them. Be persistent. Ask questions. These are the keys to learning how to build things on the web.</p>
