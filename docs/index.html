              <p>Accessibility has been a concern for users of the Web since the beginning. I've read the statistic that 1 in 5 users of the Web need some sort of assistance when using a browser. That could be as severe as complete blindness all the way to just needing to make the text larger for older eyes. For the beginner dev all the way to the seasoned professional accessibility should be a chief concern for a front end developer. It is one of the things that a Web developer specifically brings to the table every time.</p>
              <p>I want to share some baseline thoughts and resources to help you create better (i.e., more accessible) sites, pages, and apps.</p>
              <p>Here are some practical first steps, or basics, of Web accessibility:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Write semantic markup.</strong> One of the best ways to get started writing more accessible pages is to use appropriate HTML5 markup. Don't use a <code>div</code> when there is a more appropriate semantic tag available. Look over your naked code in HTML (without CSS) and see if there are areas that you can clearly markup as headers, footers, navigation, and so on. Is there a more sensible way to separate the content? Use some (or all) of the resources at the end of this post to see or hear how the site will be accessed through the HTML.</li>
                <li><strong>Allow your visual content to speak.</strong> Visual content is great for sighted users. However, what if images are turned off or the user is unable to see them? There are rock solid ways to let the user know the content of images on the Web. Note that if the image is described in the content itself, or is only there for decoration, no alt text is necessary. Go through your images and determine what visual content needs to be understood and what is on the page simply to make things look good.</li>
                <li><strong>Make forms easier to understand and use.</strong> This is one of the big ones. Forms have been the bane of existence from the beginning but they are very important to the modern Web so you need to know how to use them and use them well. The biggest thing you can do is connect the form label with the input it describes. (And yes, you need to use the <code>label</code> tag for your inputs.) Using a <code>label</code> for your inputs allows the user to tab understandably and will also help screen readers connect labels with the appropriate inputs in a way that can be audibly understood.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the right tags for links.</strong> Links are another big issue. Use an anchor link when the link takes you to another page or off the site completely (an HTTP request) and use a button when the action happens on the same page or view. You get some inherent styling and behavior when you use the right elements. This is one of those instances. If you try to do everything through JavaScript then you're essentially building the behavior back into the element that you could have gotten by just using the right element in the first place. Do the right thing.</li>
                <li><strong>Give interactive elements some space.</strong> This is one that not many people think about. Modern design (think Apple.com) is built on the premise of large type and lots of nice negative (white) space between sections, words, and elements. This is more than a design aesthetic, it's also a practical way to give users with disabilities the opportunity to take the right actions. If the clickable elements are too close together then the odds of clicking the wrong thing go up. Can you click the right element when your hands are shaking? Then there is probably enough space between them. If not, create some space with margins and make the hit areas larger through padding.</li>
                <p>That's only scratching the surface. I promise you, though, that adding these elements in will not only help disabled users but the site or app in general. The bots will also love you and understand your content better which will help boost your search rankings. Devs who come along after you will probably praise you.</p>
                <p>Here are some great resources to get you started:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML" target="_blank">Accessibility on Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://a11yproject.com/" target="_blank">The A11Y Project</a></li>
                  <li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every small step you take helps take care of the ecosystem of a site or app. It's like picking up a piece of trash on the ground next to a trash can and throwing it away. It seems small but it's the these small (but easy) things that add up over time. Take the time to learn accessibility well and then do it.</p>
