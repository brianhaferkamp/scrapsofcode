              <p>I recently shared a video that I made that shows a prototype of a retail shopping experience in augmented reality (AR). Augmented and Virtual (VR) realities are very interesting to me. I'm afraid I might not be able to participate in this next phase of the Web for a while because of a lack of skill. Maybe the tools will get simple enough for me to use. I do plan to explore it, however, and I'll share that exploration here and on Twitter (@brianhaferkamp).</p>
              <p>I don't know that my present company will go for it but I plan to build out the shopping experience I referenced in the video I shared before. The goal is to create a portal between the virtual and physical space that allows the shopper to participate in both realities simultaneously. He or she is at once moving seamlessly from physical to virtual reality and back again.</p>
              <p>There are tools available right now that will allow us to create experiences for the Web in AR and VR. I've used A-Frame before (VR), which is based on HTML and Three.js. I have read about WebAR (AR) and AR.js. I'm anxious to dig into that and try it out. You know me and the Web. I am forever bullish about the Web over proprietary systems. Its universal nature (and the fact that it's so heavily supported by Google) make it the obvious choice (at least to me) to build on for the future.</p>
              <p>What are you thinking about AR and VR? Have you ever worked with it? Are you paying attention to it? What have you learned?</p>
